description: Take a Technical Requirements Document (TRD) and implement it using git-town feature branch workflow with ai-mesh-orchestrator delegation for complete implementation, review, and testing by specialized sub-agents
---

## Mission

This command takes a comprehensive Technical Requirements Document (TRD) and implements it using modern git-town feature branch workflow. It creates an appropriately named feature branch and delegates the complete implementation to the ai-mesh-orchestrator, which performs strategic request analysis and routes to tech-lead-orchestrator for structured development methodology including planning, architecture validation, task breakdown, development loops, code review, testing, and deployment.

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- **Git Town**: Modern Git workflow automation tool
  - Installation: `brew install git-town` (macOS) or `curl -s https://install.git-town.com | sh` (Linux)
  - Configuration: `git town config` (for first-time setup)
  - Verification: `git town version` should show installed version

### Git Town Setup Verification
The command will automatically check for git-town installation and configuration:
1. **Installation Check**: Verify `git town` command is available
2. **Repository Check**: Ensure current directory is a git repository
3. **Configuration Check**: Validate git-town is configured with main branch
4. **Branch Status**: Check for clean working directory before creating feature branch

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Prerequisites & Feature Branch Setup
1. **Git Town Verification**: Check git-town installation and configuration
2. **Feature Branch Creation**: Create feature branch using `git town hack <branch-name>`
   - Branch name format: `feature/<trd-filename-without-extension>`
   - Example: `@docs/TRD/user-auth-system-trd.md` → `feature/user-auth-system-trd`
3. **TRD Ingestion**: Parse and analyze existing TRD document with **checkbox tracking**
4. **Technical Feasibility Review**: Validate implementation approach and architecture
5. **Resource Assessment**: Identify required specialist agents and tools
6. **Context Preparation**: Prepare TRD for implementation delegation

### Phase 2: AI Mesh Orchestrator Delegation
1. **Strategic Request Analysis**: ai-mesh-orchestrator performs strategic analysis of TRD implementation requirements
2. **Development Project Classification**: Identifies as "development_project" requiring full methodology
3. **Tech Lead Orchestrator Delegation**: Routes to tech-lead-orchestrator for complete traditional development methodology
4. **Implementation Orchestration**: tech-lead-orchestrator manages planning, architecture, task breakdown, development loops, and quality gates
5. **Specialist Agent Coordination**: tech-lead-orchestrator delegates to appropriate specialist agents based on technical requirements

### Phase 3: Progressive Implementation with Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. **Planning & Architecture Validation**: Validate TRD architecture against current system constraints
2. **Task Status Assessment**: **Review completed work** before proceeding with incomplete tasks
3. **Test-Driven Implementation**: For ALL coding tasks, follow TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
   - **RED**: Write failing tests first based on acceptance criteria
   - **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
   - **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while maintaining passing tests
4. **TDD Quality Gates**: Validate test coverage (≥80% unit, ≥70% integration) before task completion
5. **Incremental Implementation**: Work through **unchecked tasks** systematically with TDD workflow
6. **Continuous Integration**: Test and validate completed work before moving to next tasks
7. **Quality Gates**: Code review, security scanning, performance validation, and DoD enforcement
8. **Sprint Review**: **Mark completed tasks as done** and validate sprint objectives with test validation
9. **Documentation & Deployment**: Update documentation, create deployment procedures, and production readiness

## Expected TRD Input Format

This command expects a TRD generated by `/prd-to-trd` with the following structure:

### Required Sections
- **System Architecture**: Component design, data flow, and integration points
- **Technical Specifications**: APIs, data contracts, performance requirements
- **Implementation Tasks**: Detailed task breakdown with estimates (2-8 hour tasks) **with checkboxes** and TDD requirements
- **Quality Requirements**: Security, performance, accessibility, and testing standards with TDD compliance
- **Sprint Planning**: Organized development phases with dependencies **with trackable task lists**
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable validation criteria for each component **with checkbox tracking**

### Expected TRD Checkbox Format
The TRD should contain tasks in this format:
```markdown
## Sprint 1: Core Implementation (TDD Required)
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Set up development environment (4 hours) - TDD: Setup test framework
- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Implement authentication API (6 hours) - TDD: Write auth tests first
- [x] **Task 1.3**: Create user registration endpoint (4 hours) ✅ COMPLETED - TDD: Tests pass

## Agent Delegation Flow

```
User Request → implement-trd /path/to/trd.md
    ↓
Git Town Prerequisites Check (installation, configuration, clean working directory)
    ↓
Extract Branch Name from TRD Filename (remove path and .md extension)
    ↓
Create Feature Branch: git town hack feature/<trd-filename>
    ↓
Read and Parse TRD Document
    ↓
Validate TRD Completeness and Technical Specifications
    ↓
Task(ai-mesh-orchestrator, "Analyze this validated TRD and delegate to tech-lead-orchestrator for complete development methodology implementation")
    ↓
ai-mesh-orchestrator performs strategic request analysis:
  • Classifies as "development_project" requiring full methodology
  • Assesses scope as comprehensive implementation project  
  • Determines strategic delegation to tech-lead-orchestrator needed
    ↓
ai-mesh-orchestrator delegates to tech-lead-orchestrator with complete TRD context
    ↓
tech-lead-orchestrator follows complete development methodology:
  • Phase 1: Plan & Requirements (validate TRD architecture and constraints)
  • Phase 2: Architecture & Design (system design validation and refinement)
  • Phase 3: Task Status Review (analyze completed vs incomplete tasks)
  • Phase 4: Progressive Implementation (work only on unchecked tasks)
  • Implementation Loops: Iterative development with specialist agent delegation
  • Work Validation: Review and mark completed tasks before proceeding
  • Quality Gates: Code review, testing, security scanning, performance validation
  • Deployment: Production readiness and deployment procedures
    ↓
tech-lead-orchestrator delegates to specialist agents based on TRD requirements:
  • frontend-developer: UI/UX implementation with accessibility compliance
  • backend-developer: Server-side logic, APIs, and database integration
  • react-component-architect: React-specific patterns and state management
  • rails-backend-expert: Rails MVC, ActiveRecord, and background jobs  
  • nestjs-backend-expert: Node.js backend with NestJS framework
  • test-runner: Unit and integration test implementation
  • playwright-tester: E2E testing and browser automation
  • code-reviewer: Security scanning and DoD enforcement
  • git-workflow: Version control and deployment procedures
    ↓
Return complete implementation status and deployment readiness
```

## Strategic Delegation Logic

Based on ai-mesh-orchestrator's delegation framework:

```
IF request_type == "development_project" AND requires_full_methodology
  → DELEGATE to tech-lead-orchestrator
  (Handles: planning, architecture, task breakdown, development loops, quality gates)

TRD Implementation Classification:
  • request_type: "development_project" (comprehensive technical implementation)
  • requires_full_methodology: TRUE (complete system implementation from TRD)
  • scope: Multi-component system requiring orchestrated development approach  
  • complexity: Strategic (orchestration needed for coordinated implementation)
```

## Success Criteria

- **TRD Validation**: TRD parsed and validated for technical completeness
- **Architecture Implementation**: System components built according to TRD specifications
- **Quality Standards**: All DoD requirements met with security and performance validation
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing (unit ≥80%, integration ≥70%, E2E coverage)
- **Performance Requirements**: All performance benchmarks from TRD achieved
- **Production Readiness**: Code ready for deployment with documentation and deployment guides

## Integration Points

- **PRD-to-TRD Integration**: Designed to work with TRDs generated by `/prd-to-trd` command
- **AgentOS Standards**: Follows DoD template from docs/agentos/DefinitionOfDone.md
- **AI Mesh Orchestration**: Leverages ai-mesh-orchestrator's strategic delegation capabilities
- **Context7 Integration**: Pulls relevant technical documentation and examples during implementation
- **Linear Integration**: Updates technical epics and implementation stories with progress
- **Git Workflow Integration**: Creates feature branches, commits, and pull requests

## Git Town Workflow Integration

### Feature Branch Workflow
1. **Branch Creation**: `git town hack feature/<trd-filename>`
   - Automatically creates feature branch from main
   - Sets up proper upstream tracking
   - Switches to new feature branch for development

2. **Development Process**: All implementation work happens on feature branch
   - Regular commits with conventional commit messages
   - Progressive task completion with TRD checkbox updates
   - Continuous integration and testing

3. **Feature Completion**: When TRD is 100% complete
   - Run final quality gates and validation
   - Create pull request for code review
   - Option to use `git town propose` for automated PR creation

### Branch Naming Convention
- **Pattern**: `feature/<trd-filename-without-extension>`
- **Examples**:
  - `@docs/TRD/user-auth-system-trd.md` → `feature/user-auth-system-trd`
  - `@docs/TRD/analytics-dashboard-trd.md` → `feature/analytics-dashboard-trd`
  - `@docs/TRD/real-time-activity-feed-enhancement-trd.md` → `feature/real-time-activity-feed-enhancement-trd`

### Git Town Commands Integration
- **Initial Setup**: `git town hack <branch-name>` - Create and switch to feature branch
- **Sync with Main**: `git town sync` - Keep feature branch updated with main
- **Propose Changes**: `git town propose` - Create pull request when implementation complete
- **Ship Changes**: `git town ship` - Merge feature branch and clean up (post-review)

## Quality Gates

- **Git Town Prerequisites**: Verify installation, configuration, and clean working directory
- **Feature Branch Setup**: Successful branch creation and checkout
- TRD technical feasibility and completeness validation
- Architecture design implementation verification
- Security vulnerability scanning and remediation
- Performance benchmark testing and optimization

  - DOCUMENTATION: documentation-specialist (component API docs and usage guides)
```

## TRD Task Management System

### Task Parsing and Identification

The implement-trd command automatically parses TRD files to identify tasks with the format:

```markdown
- [ ] **TRD-XXX**: Task Description (Xh) - Priority: [High|Medium|Low] - Depends: [TRD-YYY, TRD-ZZZ]
```

### Task Completion Workflow

#### 1. Task Identification and Validation
- Parse TRD files to extract task IDs, descriptions, dependencies, and current status
- Validate task dependencies before allowing completion
- Check for prerequisite task completion

#### 2. Task Execution and Completion (TDD Workflow)
- **For coding tasks**: Delegate TDD implementation (Red-Green-Refactor) to appropriate specialized agents
- **Test-First Approach**: Ensure tests written before implementation code
- Mark tasks as completed when all acceptance criteria met AND tests pass
- Update checkbox status: `- [ ]` → `- [x]` with TDD validation
- Update task timestamps and completion metadata including test coverage

#### 3. Progress Statistics Updates
- Calculate and update completion percentages
- Update task summary sections automatically
- Refresh project status indicators

#### 4. Dependency Management
- Track task dependencies and enable dependent tasks when prerequisites complete
- Validate dependency chains before task execution
- Prevent circular dependencies and orphaned tasks

### Document Lifecycle Management

#### Completion Detection
- Monitor TRD task completion percentage
- Trigger archival workflow when all tasks (100%) are completed
- Validate all quality gates before archival

#### Automatic Document Archival
When all TRD tasks are completed (100% completion with all checkboxes marked ✓):

**IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT**: The ai-mesh-orchestrator MUST use Read and Write tools to actually perform file operations. Simply mentioning archival without file operations is insufficient.

1. **Verify 100% Completion**:
   - Parse TRD file and count all task checkboxes
   - Verify: `(tasks_marked_✓ / total_tasks) * 100 === 100%`
   - Ensure no □ or ☐ checkboxes remain

2. **Create Archive Directories** (if they don't exist):
   ```bash
   # Check if directories exist using Bash tool or Read tool
   # Create if missing:
   @docs/TRD/completed/
   @docs/PRD/completed/
   ```

3. **Archive TRD with Timestamp**:
   ```bash
   # Example: @docs/TRD/user-auth-system-trd.md
   # Step 1: Read TRD file content using Read tool
   # Step 2: Generate timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2025-10-12)
   # Step 3: Extract base filename: "user-auth-system-trd"
   # Step 4: Create new filename: "user-auth-system-trd-2025-10-12.md"
   # Step 5: Write content using Write tool to:
   #         @docs/TRD/completed/user-auth-system-trd-2025-10-12.md
   # Step 6: Optionally remove original from @docs/TRD/ after successful write
   ```

4. **Archive Related PRD with Same Timestamp**:
   ```bash
   # Example: @docs/PRD/user-auth-system-prd.md
   # Step 1: Derive PRD filename from TRD (replace "-trd" with "-prd")
   # Step 2: Check if PRD file exists using Read tool
   # Step 3: If exists, read PRD file content
   # Step 4: Use SAME timestamp as TRD archival
   # Step 5: Write content using Write tool to:
   #         @docs/PRD/completed/user-auth-system-prd-2025-10-12.md
   # Step 6: Optionally remove original from @docs/PRD/ after successful write
   ```

5. **Update Cross-References**:
   - Document the archival action with completion timestamp
   - Update any remaining references to archived documents
   - Create completion summary with final metrics
   - Log archival action with timestamp and completion statistics

6. **Notify User with Archive Paths**:
   ```
   ✅ TRD Implementation Complete!

   All [X] tasks finished successfully.

   Archived files:
   - @docs/TRD/completed/project-name-trd-2025-10-12.md
   - @docs/PRD/completed/project-name-prd-2025-10-12.md (if exists)

   Project completion summary available in archived documents.
   ```

**CRITICAL**: The archival process is NOT complete until files are actually read from source locations and written to completed/ directories with timestamp naming. Document references alone are insufficient.

### Task Status Tracking Format

#### Updated Task Completion Status Section
```markdown
## Task Completion Status

**Last Updated**: [AUTO-GENERATED TIMESTAMP]
**Completion Rate**: X% (X of Y tasks completed)

### Recently Completed Tasks
- [x] **TRD-001**: Environment setup and development tools (4h) - Completed: 2025-09-19 14:23
- [x] **TRD-005**: Authentication system architecture (6h) - Completed: 2025-09-19 16:45

### In Progress Tasks
- [ ] **TRD-013**: User registration API endpoint (4h) - Started: 2025-09-19 17:00

### Next Priority Tasks
1. **TRD-014**: User login/logout API endpoints (4h) - Ready to start (depends: TRD-005 ✓)
2. **TRD-015**: JWT token management service (3h) - Blocked (depends: TRD-005 ✓, TRD-013 ⏳)
```

### Integration with Agent Mesh

#### Task Assignment Logic
- **TRD-001 to TRD-020**: Foundation tasks → infrastructure-management-subagent, backend-developer
- **TRD-021 to TRD-040**: Development tasks → frontend-developer, backend-developer, framework specialists
- **TRD-041 to TRD-060**: Testing tasks → test-runner, playwright-tester, qa-orchestrator
- **TRD-061+**: Documentation/deployment → documentation-specialist, deployment-orchestrator

#### Quality Gate Integration
- Code review required via code-reviewer before marking tasks complete
- Test validation via test-runner for all implementation tasks
- Security validation for authentication and data handling tasks
- Performance validation for optimization and infrastructure tasks

## Work Review and Progress Tracking

### Pre-Implementation Assessment

Before starting any work, the tech-lead-orchestrator will:

1. **Parse TRD Checkboxes**: Identify all tasks marked with `[ ]` (incomplete) vs `[x]` (completed)
2. **Assess Current State**: Review existing codebase to validate completed task claims
3. **Verify Completeness**: Ensure tasks marked as done actually have working implementations
4. **Plan Remaining Work**: Focus only on unchecked tasks and missing functionality

### Progressive Implementation Process

```
1. REVIEW PHASE:
   ├── Read TRD with checkbox analysis
   ├── Validate completed tasks against codebase
   ├── Identify incomplete/missing tasks
   └── Update TRD checkboxes if misaligned

2. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:
   ├── Work only on unchecked tasks: [ ]
   ├── Test each completed task immediately
   ├── Mark tasks complete when working: [x]
   └── Update TRD file with progress

3. VALIDATION PHASE:
   ├── Verify all sprint objectives met
   ├── Run comprehensive test suite
   ├── Update documentation
   └── Mark sprint complete when all tasks [x]
```

### Task Completion Workflow (TDD Required)

For each unchecked coding task, the process follows TDD Red-Green-Refactor:
1. **RED Phase**: Write failing tests first based on acceptance criteria
2. **GREEN Phase**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code quality while maintaining passing tests
4. **Test Validation**: Verify comprehensive test coverage (≥80% unit, ≥70% integration)
5. **Review**: Code review and quality gates with TDD compliance check
6. **Mark Complete**: Update TRD checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]` with test validation
7. **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with previously completed tasks and their tests

### Performance Monitoring

The ai-mesh-orchestrator will track implementation performance using agent activity tracking:

- **Task Completion Times**: Monitor specialist agent performance against TRD estimates with TDD cycle time
- **Quality Metrics**: Track code review findings, test coverage, and performance benchmarks with TDD compliance
- **TDD Compliance**: Monitor Red-Green-Refactor cycle adherence and test-first development
- **Integration Success**: Measure handoff efficiency between specialist agents including test handoffs
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates of checkbox completion in TRD with test validation status
- **User Satisfaction**: Validate implementation meets TRD acceptance criteria with comprehensive test coverage

## Task Execution Workflow with Intelligent Agent Delegation

### Agent Delegation Logic

#### Development Tasks

- **Frontend Work**: → frontend-developer, react-component-architect
- **Backend Work**: → backend-developer, rails-backend-expert, nestjs-backend-expert
- **Full-Stack Features**: → Coordinate frontend + backend agents
- **Database Changes**: → backend-developer + schema specialists

#### Quality & Testing (TDD-Integrated)

- **TDD Implementation**: → test-runner (Red phase - write tests first)
- **Code Implementation**: → development agents (Green phase - minimal passing code)
- **Code Refactoring**: → development agents (Refactor phase - improve while tests pass)
- **Code Review**: → code-reviewer (after all implementations with TDD compliance check)
- **E2E Testing**: → playwright-tester (integration with unit tests)
- **Performance Testing**: → specialized testing agents with test coverage validation

#### Workflow Management

- **Git Operations**: → git-workflow
- **File Operations**: → file-creator, directory-monitor
- **Documentation**: → documentation-specialist
- **Context Research**: → context-fetcher

### Coordination Patterns

#### Sequential Workflows (TDD-Enhanced)

1. **Planning Phase**: Receive TRD from tech-lead-orchestrator with TDD requirements
2. **Red Phase**: Write failing tests based on acceptance criteria (test-runner)
3. **Green Phase**: Implement minimal code to pass tests (development agents)
4. **Refactor Phase**: Improve code quality while maintaining passing tests (development agents)
5. **Testing Phase**: Validate comprehensive test coverage (testing specialists)
6. **Quality Gate**: Enforce code review with TDD compliance validation
7. **Documentation Phase**: Update docs including test documentation and complete workflow

#### Parallel Workflows

- **Frontend + Backend**: Coordinate simultaneous development
- **Multiple Features**: Manage independent feature development
- **Testing Streams**: Parallel unit and integration testing

#### Quality Gates

- **Pre-Implementation**: Validate requirements and dependencies with test requirements
- **Red Gate**: Ensure failing tests written before implementation
- **Green Gate**: Validate minimal passing implementation
- **Refactor Gate**: Ensure code quality improvement while tests pass
- **Pre-Review**: Ensure completeness before code review with TDD compliance
- **Pre-Merge**: Final validation and approval workflow with test coverage verification

## Best Practices for TRD Implementation

### Task Specification Guidelines
- Provide clear task specifications with measurable acceptance criteria
- Reference existing TRDs and technical specifications for context
- Include dependencies and prerequisite information
- Specify quality requirements and validation criteria
- Set realistic timelines and resource constraints

### TRD Task Management Best Practices (TDD-Enhanced)
- Use unique task IDs (TRD-XXX format) for all trackable tasks with TDD indicators
- Include time estimates (2-8 hour granularity) accounting for Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- Define clear dependencies including test dependencies to enable proper sequencing
- Assign appropriate priority levels (High/Medium/Low) with TDD complexity assessment
- Validate task completion against acceptance criteria AND test coverage before marking complete
- Ensure all coding tasks follow TDD methodology with test-first development

### Quality Assurance Integration (TDD-Compliant)
- Ensure TDD compliance validation (Red-Green-Refactor cycle followed)
- Validate comprehensive test coverage (≥80% unit, ≥70% integration) for all coding tasks
- Ensure code review via code-reviewer before task completion with TDD verification
- Perform security review for authentication and data handling with security tests
- Conduct performance validation for optimization tasks with performance tests
- Document completion with timestamps, completion metadata, and test coverage reports

### Document Lifecycle Management
- Monitor TRD completion percentage continuously
- Trigger archival workflow only when 100% completion achieved
- Preserve document history with timestamped archive copies
- Update cross-references and maintain documentation integrity
- Generate completion summaries with final project metrics

## Implementation Example

Using the Python to Node.js hooks conversion TRD (`/docs/TRD/python-to-nodejs-hooks-conversion-trd.md`), the command would:

1. **Git Town Prerequisites Check**: Verify git-town installation and repository status
2. **Feature Branch Creation**: `git town hack feature/python-to-nodejs-hooks-conversion-trd`
3. **Parse TRD sections**: Extract architecture design, implementation tasks with **checkbox status analysis**
4. **Review completed work**: Check existing codebase against completed checkboxes `[x]`
5. **Identify remaining tasks**: Focus on unchecked tasks `[ ]` that need implementation
6. **Delegate to ai-mesh-orchestrator**: Route TRD with work status and remaining tasks context
5. **Progressive implementation** (only unchecked tasks):
   - backend-developer: Complete remaining Node.js conversion tasks
   - file-creator: Create missing project structure components
   - test-runner: Implement missing unit tests for statistical functions
   - code-reviewer: Review new implementations and validate completed work
   - playwright-tester: Run integration tests for newly implemented features
   - documentation-specialist: Update guides for newly completed functionality
   - git-workflow: Update feature branch with completed tasks and mark checkboxes
6. **Continuous validation**: Mark tasks complete `[x]` as they are implemented and tested
7. **Sprint completion**: Verify all sprint tasks marked complete before moving to next sprint
8. **Production delivery**: Complete Node.js hooks implementation with all checkboxes marked
