description: Take a Technical Requirements Document (TRD) generated by /prd-to-trd and delegate to ai-mesh-orchestrator for complete implementation, review, and testing by specialized sub-agents
---

## Mission

This command takes a comprehensive Technical Requirements Document (TRD) and delegates the complete implementation to the ai-mesh-orchestrator, which performs strategic request analysis and routes to tech-lead-orchestrator for structured development methodology including planning, architecture validation, task breakdown, development loops, code review, testing, and deployment.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: TRD Analysis & Validation
1. **TRD Ingestion**: Parse and analyze existing TRD document with **checkbox tracking**
2. **Technical Feasibility Review**: Validate implementation approach and architecture
3. **Resource Assessment**: Identify required specialist agents and tools
4. **Context Preparation**: Prepare TRD for implementation delegation

### Phase 2: AI Mesh Orchestrator Delegation
1. **Strategic Request Analysis**: ai-mesh-orchestrator performs strategic analysis of TRD implementation requirements
2. **Development Project Classification**: Identifies as "development_project" requiring full methodology
3. **Tech Lead Orchestrator Delegation**: Routes to tech-lead-orchestrator for complete traditional development methodology
4. **Implementation Orchestration**: tech-lead-orchestrator manages planning, architecture, task breakdown, development loops, and quality gates
5. **Specialist Agent Coordination**: tech-lead-orchestrator delegates to appropriate specialist agents based on technical requirements

### Phase 3: Progressive Implementation with Work Review
1. **Planning & Architecture Validation**: Validate TRD architecture against current system constraints
2. **Task Status Assessment**: **Review completed work** before proceeding with incomplete tasks
3. **Incremental Implementation**: Work through **unchecked tasks** systematically
4. **Continuous Integration**: Test and validate completed work before moving to next tasks
5. **Quality Gates**: Code review, security scanning, performance validation, and DoD enforcement
6. **Sprint Review**: **Mark completed tasks as done** and validate sprint objectives
7. **Documentation & Deployment**: Update documentation, create deployment procedures, and production readiness

## Expected TRD Input Format

This command expects a TRD generated by `/prd-to-trd` with the following structure:

### Required Sections
- **System Architecture**: Component design, data flow, and integration points
- **Technical Specifications**: APIs, data contracts, performance requirements
- **Implementation Tasks**: Detailed task breakdown with estimates (2-8 hour tasks) **with checkboxes**
- **Quality Requirements**: Security, performance, accessibility, and testing standards
- **Sprint Planning**: Organized development phases with dependencies **with trackable task lists**
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable validation criteria for each component **with checkbox tracking**

### Expected TRD Checkbox Format
The TRD should contain tasks in this format:
```markdown
## Sprint 1: Core Implementation
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Set up development environment (4 hours)
- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Implement authentication API (6 hours)
- [x] **Task 1.3**: Create user registration endpoint (4 hours) ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] **Task 1.4**: Add input validation (2 hours)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **AC 1**: User can register with valid email ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] **AC 2**: Invalid email addresses are rejected
- [ ] **AC 3**: Password complexity requirements enforced
```

### Example TRD Reference
See `/docs/TRD/python-to-nodejs-hooks-conversion-trd.md` for a complete example of the expected TRD format that this command processes.

## Agent Delegation Flow

```
User Request → implement-trd /path/to/trd.md
    ↓
Read and Parse TRD Document
    ↓
Validate TRD Completeness and Technical Specifications
    ↓
Task(ai-mesh-orchestrator, "Analyze this validated TRD and delegate to tech-lead-orchestrator for complete development methodology implementation")
    ↓
ai-mesh-orchestrator performs strategic request analysis:
  • Classifies as "development_project" requiring full methodology
  • Assesses scope as comprehensive implementation project  
  • Determines strategic delegation to tech-lead-orchestrator needed
    ↓
ai-mesh-orchestrator delegates to tech-lead-orchestrator with complete TRD context
    ↓
tech-lead-orchestrator follows complete development methodology:
  • Phase 1: Plan & Requirements (validate TRD architecture and constraints)
  • Phase 2: Architecture & Design (system design validation and refinement)
  • Phase 3: Task Status Review (analyze completed vs incomplete tasks)
  • Phase 4: Progressive Implementation (work only on unchecked tasks)
  • Implementation Loops: Iterative development with specialist agent delegation
  • Work Validation: Review and mark completed tasks before proceeding
  • Quality Gates: Code review, testing, security scanning, performance validation
  • Deployment: Production readiness and deployment procedures
    ↓
tech-lead-orchestrator delegates to specialist agents based on TRD requirements:
  • frontend-developer: UI/UX implementation with accessibility compliance
  • backend-developer: Server-side logic, APIs, and database integration
  • react-component-architect: React-specific patterns and state management
  • rails-backend-expert: Rails MVC, ActiveRecord, and background jobs  
  • nestjs-backend-expert: Node.js backend with NestJS framework
  • test-runner: Unit and integration test implementation
  • playwright-tester: E2E testing and browser automation
  • code-reviewer: Security scanning and DoD enforcement
  • git-workflow: Version control and deployment procedures
    ↓
Return complete implementation status and deployment readiness
```

## Strategic Delegation Logic

Based on ai-mesh-orchestrator's delegation framework:

```
IF request_type == "development_project" AND requires_full_methodology
  → DELEGATE to tech-lead-orchestrator
  (Handles: planning, architecture, task breakdown, development loops, quality gates)

TRD Implementation Classification:
  • request_type: "development_project" (comprehensive technical implementation)
  • requires_full_methodology: TRUE (complete system implementation from TRD)
  • scope: Multi-component system requiring orchestrated development approach  
  • complexity: Strategic (orchestration needed for coordinated implementation)
```

## Work Review and Progress Tracking

### Pre-Implementation Assessment

Before starting any work, the tech-lead-orchestrator will:

1. **Parse TRD Checkboxes**: Identify all tasks marked with `[ ]` (incomplete) vs `[x]` (completed)
2. **Assess Current State**: Review existing codebase to validate completed task claims
3. **Verify Completeness**: Ensure tasks marked as done actually have working implementations
4. **Plan Remaining Work**: Focus only on unchecked tasks and missing functionality

### Progressive Implementation Process

```
1. REVIEW PHASE:
   ├── Read TRD with checkbox analysis
   ├── Validate completed tasks against codebase
   ├── Identify incomplete/missing tasks
   └── Update TRD checkboxes if misaligned

2. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:
   ├── Work only on unchecked tasks: [ ]
   ├── Test each completed task immediately
   ├── Mark tasks complete when working: [x]
   └── Update TRD file with progress

3. VALIDATION PHASE:
   ├── Verify all sprint objectives met
   ├── Run comprehensive test suite
   ├── Update documentation
   └── Mark sprint complete when all tasks [x]
```

### Task Completion Workflow

For each unchecked task, the process follows:
1. **Implement**: Specialist agent implements the specific task
2. **Test**: Immediate testing and validation of the implementation
3. **Review**: Code review and quality gates
4. **Mark Complete**: Update TRD checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]`
5. **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with previously completed tasks

### Performance Monitoring

The ai-mesh-orchestrator will track implementation performance using agent activity tracking:

- **Task Completion Times**: Monitor specialist agent performance against TRD estimates
- **Quality Metrics**: Track code review findings, test coverage, and performance benchmarks  
- **Integration Success**: Measure handoff efficiency between specialist agents
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates of checkbox completion in TRD
- **User Satisfaction**: Validate implementation meets TRD acceptance criteria

## Implementation Example

Using the Python to Node.js hooks conversion TRD (`/docs/TRD/python-to-nodejs-hooks-conversion-trd.md`), the command would:

1. **Parse TRD sections**: Extract architecture design, implementation tasks with **checkbox status analysis**
2. **Review completed work**: Check existing codebase against completed checkboxes `[x]`
3. **Identify remaining tasks**: Focus on unchecked tasks `[ ]` that need implementation
4. **Delegate to ai-mesh-orchestrator**: Route TRD with work status and remaining tasks context
5. **Progressive implementation** (only unchecked tasks):
   - backend-developer: Complete remaining Node.js conversion tasks
   - file-creator: Create missing project structure components
   - test-runner: Implement missing unit tests for statistical functions
   - code-reviewer: Review new implementations and validate completed work
   - playwright-tester: Run integration tests for newly implemented features
   - documentation-specialist: Update guides for newly completed functionality
   - git-workflow: Update feature branch with completed tasks and mark checkboxes
6. **Continuous validation**: Mark tasks complete `[x]` as they are implemented and tested
7. **Sprint completion**: Verify all sprint tasks marked complete before moving to next sprint
8. **Production delivery**: Complete Node.js hooks implementation with all checkboxes marked

## Notes
