# Task Delegation: Helm Deployment Engine Implementation

**DELEGATED TO**: deployment-orchestrator  
**TASK**: 3.1 Helm Deployment Engine (Phase 2, Week 5, Sprint 3)  
**STATUS**: In Progress  
**ESTIMATED TIME**: 8 hours

## Context

We are implementing Phase 2 of the External Metrics Web Service with focus on deployment automation. The monitoring web service already has Kubernetes infrastructure in place, and we need to add Helm deployment capabilities.

## Task Requirements

Implement Helm deployment engine with the following capabilities:

### Core Helm Operations
1. **Install Operation**: Deploy new releases with pre/post hooks
2. **Upgrade Operation**: Rolling updates with validation 
3. **Rollback Operation**: Restore previous versions with state preservation
4. **Delete Operation**: Clean removal with resource cleanup
5. **Status Tracking**: Real-time operation status monitoring
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery mechanisms

### Implementation Structure

Create the following files in the monitoring web service:

```
.ai-mesh/src/monitoring-web-service/infrastructure/helm/
├── deployment-engine.js           # Main Helm deployment engine
├── operations/
│   ├── install.js                 # Helm install operation
│   ├── upgrade.js                 # Helm upgrade operation  
│   ├── rollback.js                # Helm rollback operation
│   └── delete.js                  # Helm delete operation
├── status-tracker.js              # Operation status tracking
├── validators/
│   ├── pre-deployment.js          # Pre-deployment validation
│   └── post-deployment.js         # Post-deployment validation
└── utils/
    ├── helm-cli.js                 # Helm CLI wrapper
    └── error-handler.js            # Error handling utilities
```

### Technical Requirements

- **Integration**: Work with existing kubectl integration in `.ai-mesh/src/monitoring-web-service/k8s/`
- **Helm CLI**: Wrap Helm CLI commands with proper error handling
- **Status Reporting**: Real-time operation progress tracking
- **Hooks Support**: Pre/post deployment hooks execution
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail and operation logging
- **Performance Targets**:
  - Install operations: <5 minutes for standard deployments
  - Upgrade operations: <3 minutes for rolling updates  
  - Rollback operations: <1 minute for automatic rollback
  - Status checks: Real-time (<1 second response)

### Existing Infrastructure

The monitoring web service already has:
- Kubernetes manifests in `k8s/` directory
- Helm chart in `helm-chart/` directory
- Docker containerization
- Infrastructure templates in `infrastructure/` directory

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Helm deployment engine fully operational
- [ ] All CRUD operations (install/upgrade/rollback/delete) working
- [ ] Integration with existing Kubernetes infrastructure
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- [ ] Performance targets achieved
- [ ] Complete test coverage

## Instructions

Begin implementing the Helm deployment engine immediately. Focus on creating a robust, production-ready system that integrates seamlessly with the existing monitoring web service infrastructure.

Use the deployment orchestrator methodology from your agent configuration to ensure proper implementation phases, quality gates, and safety mechanisms.
