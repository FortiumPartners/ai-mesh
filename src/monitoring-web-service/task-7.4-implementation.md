# Task 7.4: Admin Reporting Dashboard Implementation

## Requirements
Implement a comprehensive admin reporting dashboard with tenant analytics and system-wide metrics:

### Backend API Requirements (backend-developer)
- **GET /api/v1/admin/reports/overview** - System-wide metrics summary
- **GET /api/v1/admin/reports/tenants** - Tenant performance analytics
- **GET /api/v1/admin/reports/usage** - Usage statistics across all tenants
- **GET /api/v1/admin/reports/revenue** - Revenue and billing analytics
- **GET /api/v1/admin/reports/growth** - Growth metrics and trends
- **POST /api/v1/admin/reports/export** - Export reports to CSV/PDF
- **GET /api/v1/admin/reports/health** - System health and performance
- **GET /api/v1/admin/reports/alerts** - Active alerts and issues

### Frontend Component Requirements (react-component-architect)
- **AdminDashboardOverview**: High-level KPIs and system status
- **TenantAnalyticsGrid**: Tenant performance comparison grid
- **UsageMetricsChart**: Usage trends and patterns visualization
- **RevenueReportCard**: Revenue analytics with growth trends
- **SystemHealthPanel**: Real-time system performance metrics

   - Scheduled report delivery via email
   - Custom date range selection
   - Executive summary generation

## Implementation Approach
1. Backend analytics aggregation with efficient queries
2. Real-time dashboard updates via WebSocket
