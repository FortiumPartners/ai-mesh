### Backend API Requirements (backend-developer)
- **GET /api/v1/support/tickets** - List support tickets with filtering
- **POST /api/v1/support/tickets** - Create new support ticket
- **PUT /api/v1/support/tickets/:id** - Update ticket status/priority
- **GET /api/v1/support/tenant/:id/context** - Get tenant context for support
- **POST /api/v1/support/impersonate/:tenantId** - Admin impersonation for debugging
- **GET /api/v1/support/logs/:tenantId** - Get tenant-specific logs

### Frontend Component Requirements (frontend-developer)
- **SupportTicketList**: Ticket management interface for admins
- **TenantContextPanel**: Quick tenant information for support agents
- **ImpersonationModal**: Safe tenant impersonation interface
- **SupportLogViewer**: Tenant log viewer with filtering
- **QuickActionsPanel**: Common support actions and shortcuts

### Key Features
