#### 4. CI/CD Integration Documentation (15 minutes)
**Automated Testing Pipeline**:
```yaml
# CI/CD Testing Pipeline Documentation

## Pipeline Stages
1. Code Quality Gates
   - Linting and code formatting
   - Security vulnerability scanning
   - Code coverage validation

2. Automated Testing
   - Unit test execution
   - Integration test execution
   - Security testing automation

3. Quality Gates
   - Coverage threshold validation
   - Performance benchmark validation
   - Security scan pass/fail criteria

4. Deployment Gates
   - E2E test execution in staging
   - Performance testing validation
   - Security penetration testing
```

**Quality Gates Configuration**:
- Test coverage thresholds and enforcement
- Performance benchmarks and SLA validation
- Security scan requirements and exceptions
- Manual approval gates for critical deployments
