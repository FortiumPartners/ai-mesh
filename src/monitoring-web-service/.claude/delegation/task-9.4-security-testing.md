## Testing Methodology

### Automated Security Scanning
```bash
# OWASP ZAP automation script
#!/bin/bash
ZAP_PORT=8080
TARGET_URL="https://staging.metrics.com"

# Start ZAP daemon
zap.sh -daemon -host 0.0.0.0 -port $ZAP_PORT

# Spider the application
curl "http://localhost:$ZAP_PORT/JSON/spider/action/scan/?url=$TARGET_URL"

# Active security scan
curl "http://localhost:$ZAP_PORT/JSON/ascan/action/scan/?url=$TARGET_URL"

# Generate security report
curl "http://localhost:$ZAP_PORT/JSON/core/view/htmlreport/" > security-report.html
```

### Manual Penetration Testing
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Session management vulnerability testing
- Business logic flaw identification
- API security assessment
- Real-time feature security validation

### Custom Security Tests
```javascript
// Custom security test for multi-tenancy
describe('Multi-tenant Security', () => {
  test('should prevent cross-tenant data access', async () => {
    // Attempt to access data from different tenant
    const tenant1Token = await getTenantToken('tenant1');
    const tenant2Data = await attemptCrossTenantAccess(tenant1Token, 'tenant2');
    
    expect(tenant2Data.status).toBe(403);
    expect(tenant2Data.data).toBeNull();
  });
  
  test('should validate JWT token tenant claims', async () => {
    const manipulatedToken = manipulateTenantClaim(validToken, 'malicious-tenant');
    const response = await makeAuthenticatedRequest(manipulatedToken);
    
    expect(response.status).toBe(401);
  });
});
```
