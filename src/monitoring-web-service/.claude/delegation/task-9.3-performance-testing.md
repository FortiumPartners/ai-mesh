- Multi-tenant query isolation

**Data volumes**:
- Concurrent metrics inserts: 1000/second
- Database size: 10M+ records
- Query complexity: Multi-table joins
- Concurrent read/write operations

**Performance targets**:
- Query response time: <100ms average
- Insert throughput: >1000 records/second
- Connection pool efficiency: >90%
- Index utilization: >95% for key queries

#### 4. End-to-End System Testing (1 hour)
**Full system scenarios**:
- Complete user workflows under load
- Multi-tenant isolation under stress
- System recovery after peak load
- Data consistency validation

**Load simulation**:
- Mixed user behavior patterns
- Realistic data distributions
- Geographic load distribution
- Peak hour simulation

## Testing Infrastructure

### Load Generation Setup
```yaml
# k6 configuration example
export default function() {
  // API load testing scenarios
  let response = http.post('${BASE_URL}/api/v1/metrics/sessions', payload, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` },
  });
  
  check(response, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response time < 500ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 500,
  });
  
  sleep(1);
}

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '2m', target: 100 }, // Ramp up
    { duration: '5m', target: 1000 }, // Peak load
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 }, // Ramp down
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'],
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.01'],
  },
};
```
