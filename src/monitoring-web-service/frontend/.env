# Using proxy configuration from vite.config.ts for development
# These relative URLs will go through the Vite dev server proxy
VITE_API_URL=/api/v1
VITE_WS_URL=/ws

# For production deployment, use these instead:
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-domain.com/api/v1
# VITE_WS_URL=wss://your-domain.com/ws

# Alternative: let the frontend auto-construct URL based on current domain
# (leave both commented to enable domain-based URL construction)
# VITE_API_URL=
# VITE_WS_URL=
