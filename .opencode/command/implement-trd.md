COMMAND: /implement-trd
DESCRIPTION: Complete TRD implementation using git-town workflow with ai-mesh-orchestrator delegation and TDD methodology
VERSION: 1.0.0

PURPOSE:
This command implements a complete Technical Requirements Document (TRD) using modern
git-town feature branch workflow. It creates a feature branch and delegates to
ai-mesh-orchestrator which routes to tech-lead-orchestrator for structured TDD-based
development including planning, implementation, testing, and quality gates.

WORKFLOW:

Phase 1: Prerequisites & Feature Branch Setup
  1. Git Town Verification: Check git-town installation and configuration
  2. Feature Branch Creation: Create feature branch using git town hack
  3. TRD Ingestion: Parse and analyze existing TRD document with checkbox tracking
  4. Technical Feasibility Review: Validate implementation approach and architecture
  5. Resource Assessment: Identify required specialist agents and tools

Phase 2: AI Mesh Orchestrator Delegation
  1. Strategic Request Analysis: ai-mesh-orchestrator analyzes TRD requirements
     Delegates to: ai-mesh-orchestrator
  2. Development Project Classification: Identifies as development project requiring full methodology
  3. Tech Lead Orchestrator Delegation: Routes to tech-lead-orchestrator for development methodology
     Delegates to: tech-lead-orchestrator

Phase 3: Progressive Implementation with TDD
  1. Planning & Architecture Validation: Validate TRD architecture against current system
  2. Task Status Assessment: Review completed work before proceeding
  3. Test-Driven Implementation: Follow TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle for all code
  4. Quality Gates: Code review, security scanning, DoD enforcement
     Delegates to: code-reviewer
  5. Sprint Review: Mark completed tasks and validate objectives

EXPECTED INPUT:
Format: Technical Requirements Document (TRD)
Required sections:
- System Architecture [REQUIRED]
- Technical Specifications [REQUIRED]
- Implementation Tasks [REQUIRED]

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
Format: Implemented Features with Quality Gates
Structure:
- Feature Branch: Git-town feature branch with all implementation commits
- Implementation Code: Working code with tests (≥80% unit, ≥70% integration)
- Quality Validation: Code review passed, security scan clean, DoD met
- Documentation: Updated documentation including API docs and deployment notes
