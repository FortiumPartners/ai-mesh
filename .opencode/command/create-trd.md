COMMAND: /create-trd
DESCRIPTION: Take an existing PRD $ARGUMENTS and delegate to @tech-lead-orchestrator by the @ai-mesh-orchestrator

VERSION: 1.0.0

PURPOSE:
This command takes a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) $ARGUMENTS and delegates to
@tech-lead-orchestrator via @ai-mesh-orchestrator for technical planning, architecture design,
and implementation breakdown. All outputs are automatically saved to @docs/TRD/ directory.

WORKFLOW:

Phase 1: PRD Analysis & Validation
  1. PRD Ingestion: Parse and analyze existing PRD document $ARGUMENTS
  2. Requirements Validation: Ensure completeness of functional and non-functional requirements
  3. Acceptance Criteria Review: Validate testable acceptance criteria
  4. Context Preparation: Prepare PRD for technical planning delegation

Phase 2: Agent Mesh Delegation
  1. AI Mesh Orchestrator: Route validated PRD to @ai-mesh-orchestrator
     Delegates to: ai-mesh-orchestrator
  2. Tech Lead Orchestrator: Delegate technical planning and architecture design
     Delegates to: tech-lead-orchestrator
  3. TRD Generation: Generate Technical Requirements Document (TRD)
  4. Task Breakdown: Create actionable development tasks with estimates and checkboxes
  5. Implementation Planning: Develop sprint planning with trackable task lists

Phase 3: Output Management
  1. TRD Creation: Generate comprehensive TRD document with project-specific naming
  2. File Organization: Save to @docs/TRD/ directory with descriptive filename
  3. Version Control: Include timestamp and PRD reference for traceability
  4. Documentation Links: Update cross-references between PRD and TRD documents
