DESCRIPTION: Advanced Claude environment optimization through intelligent project analysis and context management
VERSION: 2.0.0

PURPOSE:
Advanced Claude environment optimization through intelligent project analysis, context
management, and documentation enhancement for maximum productivity gains. Optimizes
CLAUDE.md, README.md, and agent configurations for improved Claude Code performance.

WORKFLOW:

Phase 1: Intelligent Discovery & Context Mapping
  1. Deep Project Analysis: Scan directory structure with pattern recognition
  2. Context Intelligence Gathering: Extract project context and patterns

Phase 2: Strategic Optimization & Enhancement
  1. CLAUDE.md Intelligence Enhancement: Optimize for Claude Code context retention
  2. Multi-Document Consistency Engine: Align all documentation

Phase 3: Advanced Integration & Validation
  1. Agent Mesh Integration: Configure specialized agents for project workflows
  2. Claude Environment Optimization: Configure MCP servers and memory management
  3. Quality Assurance & Standards Validation: Validate against Fortium configuration standards

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
Format: Optimized Claude Configuration
Structure:
- CLAUDE.md: Optimized with intelligent context management and agent orchestration
- README.md: Aligned with current status and enhanced with productivity metrics
- Agent Configurations: Project-specific optimizations for specialized agents
