# Sprint 2 Task 2.1: Environment-specific Configuration Management Implementation Request

## Task Context
**Sprint**: 2 (Environment Management & AWS Integration)
**Task**: 2.1 - Environment-specific configuration management  
**Estimated Time**: 8 hours
**Status**: Ready for implementation
**Priority**: High (Critical path for Sprint 2)

## Implementation Requirements

### Core Deliverables Required
1. **Development environment configuration with cost optimization**
   - Resource sizing for development workloads
   - Cost-optimized instance types and scaling policies
   - Development-specific networking and security configurations
   - Resource scheduling for cost savings (auto-shutdown during off-hours)

2. **Staging environment configuration with production-like setup**
   - Production-like resource configurations at reduced scale
   - Full monitoring and alerting capabilities
   - Production-equivalent security configurations
   - Blue-green deployment testing infrastructure

3. **Production environment configuration with high availability**  
   - Multi-AZ deployment with redundancy
   - Auto-scaling groups with appropriate scaling policies
   - Production-grade monitoring, logging, and alerting
   - Disaster recovery and backup configurations

4. **Resource sizing algorithms based on environment type**
   - Dynamic resource calculation based on environment classification
   - Performance vs cost optimization matrices
   - Scaling trigger algorithms for each environment type
   - Resource limit enforcement and budget controls

5. **Configuration validation and promotion workflows**
   - Automated configuration validation and testing
   - Environment promotion pipelines (dev → staging → prod)
   - Configuration drift detection and remediation
   - Compliance validation and security scanning

## Project Technical Context
- **Location**: `/Users/ldangelo/Development/fortium/claude-config-agents/.ai-mesh/src/monitoring-web-service/`
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js/TypeScript backend, React frontend, Docker containers
- **Infrastructure**: AWS-focused with Terraform IaC
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for container management
- **Architecture**: Microservices with monitoring web service

## Current Infrastructure Status
- **Sprint 1**: ✅ Complete - Foundation infrastructure implemented
- **Terraform Modules**: ✅ Core AWS services (VPC, ECS, RDS, S3, CloudFront)
- **Docker Configuration**: ✅ Security-hardened containerization  
- **Infrastructure Templates**: ✅ 3 application architectures available

## Performance & Quality Requirements
- **Configuration Generation Time**: <60 seconds for standard patterns
- **Terraform Execution Time**: <2 minutes for typical AWS modules
- **Security Compliance**: 100% pass rate on automated security scanning
- **Cost Optimization Target**: 30% reduction through environment-specific optimization

## Validation Criteria
All implemented configurations must:
- Pass automated security scanning (tfsec, Checkov)
- Meet performance benchmarks for configuration generation and execution
- Include comprehensive documentation and usage examples
- Support promotion workflows between environments
- Include cost monitoring and optimization features

## Success Metrics
- **Environment Provisioning**: Fully automated dev/staging/prod environment creation
- **Resource Optimization**: Environment-specific resource sizing working correctly
- **Configuration Validation**: Automated validation and promotion pipelines functional
- **Cost Controls**: Budget monitoring and cost optimization features operational
- **Documentation**: Complete implementation documentation with examples

## Agent Delegation Recommendation
This task should be implemented by the **infrastructure-orchestrator** agent due to:
- Complex multi-environment AWS infrastructure configuration
- Resource sizing algorithms and cost optimization requirements  
- Configuration validation and promotion workflow complexity
- Integration with existing Terraform modules and Docker configurations
- Need for comprehensive monitoring and security implementation

## Next Steps After Implementation
Upon completion of Task 2.1, continue with:
- **Task 2.2**: CI/CD pipeline integration (8 hours)  
- **Task 2.3**: Advanced deployment patterns (8 hours)
- Sprint 2 validation and quality gate review
