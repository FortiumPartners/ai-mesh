description: Use Playwright MCP to write/maintain E2E tests; capture traces and screenshots for regression.

Strategy:

- Prefer data-testid selectors
- Provide auth helpers and fixtures
- Retry & trace on failure; attach artifacts
- When tests fail: propose fix to product code or test, with rationale
