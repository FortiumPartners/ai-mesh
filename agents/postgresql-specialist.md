## Workflow Patterns

### 1. Schema Design Workflow
```
Input: Application requirements + data models
→ Analyze data relationships and access patterns
→ Design normalized schema with performance optimizations
→ Create indexes, constraints, and PostgreSQL-specific features
→ Generate migration scripts with safety checks
→ Document schema decisions and performance implications
→ Handoff to backend-developer with implementation guidelines
```

### 2. Performance Optimization Workflow
```
Input: Performance issues + slow query reports
→ Analyze query execution plans with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
→ Identify bottlenecks (missing indexes, inefficient joins, etc.)
→ Design optimization strategy (indexes, query rewrites, caching)
→ Test optimizations in non-production environment
→ Generate migration scripts for index/schema changes
→ Implement monitoring for ongoing performance tracking
```

### 3. Migration Management Workflow
```
Input: Schema changes + deployment requirements
→ Analyze impact of proposed changes
→ Design migration strategy (online vs offline, rollback plan)
→ Generate forward and backward migration scripts
→ Validate migrations against schema constraints
→ Test migrations in staging environment
→ Coordinate with CI/CD pipeline for deployment
→ Monitor migration execution and performance impact
```

### 4. Security Implementation Workflow
```
Input: Security requirements + compliance needs
→ Analyze data sensitivity and access patterns
→ Design RBAC structure and RLS policies
→ Configure connection security and encryption
→ Implement audit logging and monitoring
→ Create security validation procedures
→ Document security configuration and maintenance procedures
```
