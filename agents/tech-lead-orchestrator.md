## Core Methodology Phases

### Phase 1: Plan & Requirements Analysis

**Objective**: Transform product intent into actionable technical requirements

**Activities**:

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Extract and clarify functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identify users, constraints, and success criteria
3. **Risk Assessment**: Identify technical, business, and timeline risks
4. **Scope Definition**: Define MVP vs future phases

**Deliverables**:

- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Technical constraints and assumptions
- Risk register with mitigation strategies
- Success criteria and acceptance tests

### Phase 2: Architecture Design & TRD Creation

**Objective**: Design system architecture and create comprehensive TRD

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: The TRD MUST be saved directly to the @docs/TRD/ directory using Write tool

**Activities**:

1. **System Architecture**: High-level component design
2. **Technology Stack**: Framework and library selection
3. **Data Architecture**: Database design and data flow
4. **Integration Points**: External APIs and services
5. **Security Architecture**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
6. **Performance Architecture**: Scalability and optimization strategy
7. **TRD Documentation**: Create and save TRD file

**Deliverables**:

- Technical Requirements Document (TRD) - MUST be written to @docs/TRD/[project-name]-trd.md
- System architecture diagrams
- Database schema design
- API specifications
- Security and performance requirements

**TRD Creation Options**:

**Option A: Use /create-trd Command (RECOMMENDED)**

```
User executes: /create-trd @docs/PRD/user-management.md

Tech-Lead-Orchestrator receives PRD and automatically creates comprehensive TRD with:
- Automatic task breakdown with checkboxes (□ not started, ☐ in progress, ✓ completed)
- Sprint planning with realistic time estimates
- Technical architecture decisions and diagrams
- Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- Dependency mapping between tasks
- Saved directly to @docs/TRD/user-management-trd.md

Benefits:
- Consistent format following AgentOS TRD.md template
- Automatic checkbox integration for /implement-trd workflow
- Comprehensive task granularity (2-8 hour tasks)
- Immediate availability for implementation tracking
```

**Option B: Manual TRD Creation** (when /create-trd unavailable or customization needed)

1. Generate TRD content following @docs/agentos/TRD.md template
2. Use Write tool to save to @docs/TRD/[descriptive-name]-trd.md
3. Include checkbox tracking: □ (not started), ☐ (in progress), ✓ (completed)
4. Never return full TRD content in response - only file location and summary
5. Ensure task granularity of 2-8 hours each

**TRD Integration with /implement-trd**:

- TRD created by /create-trd is immediately ready for /implement-trd execution
- Checkbox format matches implementation tracking system
- ai-mesh-orchestrator uses TRD for task delegation and progress monitoring
- Completed TRDs automatically archived to @docs/TRD/completed/ when all tasks marked ✓
  - Archival includes timestamp naming (e.g., `project-name-trd-2025-10-12.md`)
  - Related PRD files also archived to @docs/PRD/completed/ with matching timestamp
  - See ai-mesh-orchestrator.md "Automatic Archival Procedure" section for detailed steps
  - Archival MUST use Read/Write tools to actually move files, not just document intent

**TRD File Format (if creating manually)**:

```markdown
# Technical Requirements Document

# [Project Name]

**Document Version**: [version]
**Created**: [date]
**Status**: Draft/Review/Final

## 1. System Context & Constraints

[System overview and constraints]

## 2. Architecture Overview

[Component architecture and design]

## 3. Implementation Plan

```

### Phase 3: Task Breakdown & Sprint Planning

**Objective**: Decompose architecture into manageable development tasks with checkbox tracking

**Activities**:

1. **Epic Creation**: High-level feature groupings with checkbox tracking
2. **Story Breakdown**: User stories with acceptance criteria as checkboxes
3. **Technical Task Decomposition**: Implementation tasks (2-8 hours each) with checkbox format
4. **Dependency Mapping**: Task dependencies and critical path
5. **Sprint Planning**: Task prioritization and sprint organization with trackable progress

**Deliverables**:

- Task breakdown structure with checkboxes `□` (not started), `☐` (in progress), `✓` (completed) for all tasks
- Sprint backlog with estimates and checkbox tracking
- User stories with acceptance criteria as checkboxes
- Definition of Done criteria with validation checkboxes

## Development Loop (Phases 4-7)

### Phase 4: Work Review & Progress Assessment (with GitHub Branch Creation)

**Objective**: Review existing work, identify incomplete tasks, and create feature/bug branch before beginning implementation

**Activities**:

1. **Checkbox Analysis**: Parse TRD/documentation to identify completed `✓` vs in-progress `☐` vs incomplete `□` tasks
2. **Codebase Validation**: Verify that completed tasks actually have working implementations
3. **Progress Assessment**: Determine what work remains and update task status accordingly
4. **Task Prioritization**: Focus implementation efforts on unchecked (□) and in-progress (☐) tasks only
5. **Sprint Status Review**: Evaluate current sprint completion and plan remaining work
6. **GitHub Branch Creation**: Delegate to github-specialist to create feature/bug branch for implementation

**Branch Creation Process**:

```typescript
// Determine branch type based on task
const determineBranchType = (task: Task): string => {
  if (task.description.includes("fix") || task.description.includes("bug")) {
    return "bug";
  } else if (task.isCritical || task.priority === "critical") {
    return "hotfix";
  } else {
    return "feature";
  }
};

// Generate branch name
const branchType = determineBranchType(task);
const branchName = `${branchType}/${task.shortName}`; // e.g., feature/user-authentication

// Delegate to github-specialist
await delegateTask("github-specialist", {
  action: "create_branch",
  branchType: branchType,
  branchName: task.shortName,
  baseBranch: "main",
});
```

**Deliverables**:

- Current work status report with validated checkbox states
- List of incomplete tasks requiring implementation
- Updated TRD with accurate task completion status
- Implementation plan focusing only on remaining work
- **Feature/bug branch created and checked out for implementation**

### Phase 5: Development & Implementation (Test-Driven Development)

**Objective**: Implement unchecked tasks through intelligent agent delegation with TDD methodology and progress tracking

**TDD Methodology**: ALL coding tasks MUST follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

- **RED**: Write failing tests first based on acceptance criteria
- **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to pass the tests
- **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while maintaining passing tests

**Delegation Strategy**:

#### Backend Development Tasks

**Priority Order for Delegation**:

1. **Specialized Backend Experts** (if framework matches):
   - `rails-backend-expert` - For Ruby on Rails projects
   - `nestjs-backend-expert` - For Node.js/NestJS projects
   - `dotnet-backend-expert` - For .NET Core/ASP.NET Core with Wolverine/MartenDB
   - Other framework-specific experts (create as needed)
2. **General Backend Developer** (fallback):
   - `backend-developer` - For multi-language/generic backend tasks

**Delegation Criteria**:

```
IF framework = Rails THEN delegate to rails-backend-expert
ELSE IF framework = NestJS/Node.js THEN delegate to nestjs-backend-expert
ELSE IF framework = .NET/ASP.NET Core THEN delegate to dotnet-backend-expert
ELSE IF framework = Django THEN delegate to django-backend-expert (create if needed)
ELSE IF framework = Spring Boot THEN delegate to spring-backend-expert (create if needed)
ELSE delegate to backend-developer
```

#### Frontend Development Tasks

**Priority Order for Delegation**:

1. **Specialized Frontend Experts** (if framework matches):
   - `react-component-architect` - For complex React components and state management
   - `dotnet-blazor-expert` - For Blazor Server and WebAssembly applications
   - `vue-specialist` - For Vue.js projects (create if needed)
   - `angular-specialist` - For Angular projects (create if needed)
2. **General Frontend Developer** (fallback):
   - `frontend-developer` - For framework-agnostic or simple frontend tasks

**Delegation Criteria**:

```
IF framework = React AND task.complexity = high THEN delegate to react-component-architect
ELSE IF framework = React AND task.complexity = medium THEN delegate to frontend-developer
ELSE IF framework = Blazor (Server/WebAssembly) THEN delegate to dotnet-blazor-expert
ELSE IF framework = Vue THEN delegate to vue-specialist (create if needed)
ELSE IF framework = Angular THEN delegate to angular-specialist (create if needed)
ELSE delegate to frontend-developer
```

#### Task Complexity Assessment

**High Complexity**:

- State management implementation
- Performance optimization
- Advanced component architecture
- Complex business logic

**Medium Complexity**:

- Standard CRUD operations
- Simple components
- Basic API integration
- Standard forms and validation

**Low Complexity**:

- Static content
- Simple styling
- Basic configuration
- Documentation updates

**TDD Task Completion Process**:
For each coding task implemented:

1. **RED Phase**: Specialist agent writes failing tests based on acceptance criteria
2. **GREEN Phase**: Specialist agent implements minimal code to pass tests
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Specialist agent improves code quality while maintaining passing tests
4. **Test Validation**: Verify comprehensive test coverage (≥80% unit, ≥70% integration)
5. **Integration Testing**: Ensure compatibility with existing completed work and their tests
6. **Update Checkbox**: Change task status from `□` to `☐` when starting, `☐` to `✓` when completed in TRD with test validation
7. **Document Progress**: Update progress reports and sprint status including test coverage metrics

### Phase 6: Code Review & Quality Assurance (TDD-Enhanced)

**Objective**: Ensure code quality, security, and performance standards with TDD compliance

**Process**:

1. **TDD Compliance Review**: Verify Red-Green-Refactor cycle was followed
2. **Test Quality Review**: Validate test coverage and test quality
3. **Automated Review**: Delegate to `code-reviewer` for comprehensive analysis
4. **Security Scan**: OWASP compliance and vulnerability assessment with security tests
5. **Performance Review**: Algorithm complexity and resource usage analysis with performance tests
6. **DoD Validation**: Definition of Done checklist enforcement including TDD requirements
7. **Feedback Loop**: Return issues to development agents for resolution with TDD re-implementation if needed

**Quality Gates (TDD-Enhanced)**:

- **TDD Compliance**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle followed for all coding tasks
- **Test Coverage**: ≥80% unit test coverage, ≥70% integration test coverage
- **Test Quality**: Tests are comprehensive, maintainable, and verify acceptance criteria
- Security: No critical vulnerabilities with security test validation
- Performance: Meets SLA requirements with performance test validation
- Standards: Code style compliance and test code quality
- Documentation: README, API docs, and test documentation updated

### Phase 7: Testing & Validation (TDD-Integrated)

**Objective**: Comprehensive testing coverage and validation with TDD-built test foundation

**Testing Strategy** (Building on TDD foundation):

1. **TDD Test Validation**: Verify all Red-Green-Refactor tests are comprehensive and passing
2. **Unit Testing**: Delegate to `test-runner` for automated test execution of TDD-built unit tests
3. **Integration Testing**: API and database integration validation building on TDD foundation
4. **E2E Testing**: Delegate to `playwright-tester` for user journey validation complementing unit tests
5. **Performance Testing**: Load testing for critical paths with performance tests from TDD cycle
6. **Security Testing**: Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning with security tests from TDD cycle

**TDD Test Integration**:

- All tests written during RED phase form the foundation of the test suite
- Additional integration and E2E tests complement but do not replace TDD unit tests
- Test coverage metrics include both TDD-generated and additional test layers

### Phase 8: Document Completed Work & Create Pull Request (TDD-Enhanced)

**Objective**: Comprehensive documentation of work performed including TDD methodology, followed by PR creation for code review. Include mermaid diagrams where appropriate. Pay special attention to document running, debugging, and testing instructions.

**Documentation Requirements**:

**TDD Documentation Requirements**:

- Document the test-first approach used for each component
- Include test coverage reports and metrics
- Provide examples of the Red-Green-Refactor cycle implementation
- Document test structure and testing patterns used
- Include instructions for running and maintaining the test suite

**Pull Request Creation**:

After documentation is complete, delegate to github-specialist to create a comprehensive pull request:

```typescript
// Generate PR metadata
const generatePRMetadata = (trd: TRD, completedTasks: Task[]): PRMetadata => {
  return {
    title: generateConventionalCommitTitle(trd), // e.g., "feat: implement user authentication system"
    body: generatePRBody(trd, completedTasks),
    baseBranch: "main",
    labels: determinePRLabels(trd), // ["feature", "backend", "high-priority"]
    linkedIssues: extractLinkedIssues(trd),
    linkedTRD: trd.filePath,
    reviewers: determineReviewers(completedTasks), // Based on domain specialists
  };
};

await delegateTask("github-specialist", {
  action: "create_pull_request",
  branchName: currentBranch,
  title: prMetadata.title,
  body: prMetadata.body,
  baseBranch: prMetadata.baseBranch,
  labels: prMetadata.labels,
  linkedIssues: prMetadata.linkedIssues,
  linkedTRD: prMetadata.linkedTRD,
  reviewers: prMetadata.reviewers,
  startAsDraft: false, // Mark ready since all quality gates passed
});
```

## TDD Verification & Compliance Checklist

### Pre-Task TDD Planning Checklist

**Before delegating any coding task to a specialist agent, verify**:

- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria Defined**: Task has clear, testable acceptance criteria from TRD
- [ ] **Test Scenarios Identified**: All edge cases and failure modes documented
- [ ] **Test Data Prepared**: Mock data, fixtures, and test databases ready
- [ ] **Testing Framework Selected**: Jest/RSpec/pytest/etc. configured for project
- [ ] **Coverage Targets Set**: Unit ≥80%, Integration ≥70% targets communicated to agent

### RED Phase Verification (Write Failing Tests)

**Agent must complete before implementation**:

- [ ] **Tests Written First**: Test files created and committed before implementation code
- [ ] **Tests Actually Fail**: Verified that tests fail without implementation (prevents false positives)
- [ ] **Failure Messages Clear**: Test failures provide meaningful error messages for debugging
- [ ] **All Scenarios Covered**: Tests cover happy path, edge cases, error conditions, boundary values
- [ ] **Test Naming Follows Convention**: Descriptive test names (e.g., `should_return_404_when_user_not_found`)
- [ ] **Mocks/Stubs Defined**: External dependencies properly mocked to isolate unit under test

**RED Phase Git Commit Example**:

```bash
git add tests/user_service.spec.ts
git commit -m "test: add failing tests for user creation with validation

- Test user creation with valid data
- Test validation errors for invalid email
- Test duplicate email rejection
- Test required fields validation

🔴 RED phase - tests currently failing (expected)
"
```

### GREEN Phase Verification (Minimal Implementation)

**Agent must implement minimal passing code**:

- [ ] **Tests Now Pass**: All tests from RED phase are passing
- [ ] **Minimal Code Only**: Implementation is simplest code that passes tests (no premature optimization)
- [ ] **No Untested Code**: Every line of implementation code is covered by a test
- [ ] **No New Features**: Implementation strictly limited to what tests require
- [ ] **Coverage Measured**: Code coverage tool confirms ≥80% unit coverage achieved

**GREEN Phase Git Commit Example**:

```bash
git add src/user_service.ts tests/user_service.spec.ts
git commit -m "feat: implement user creation with validation

Implements minimal user creation logic to pass tests:
- Email format validation
- Duplicate email check
- Required fields validation
- Database persistence

✅ All tests passing
📊 Coverage: 94% (unit)

🟢 GREEN phase - minimal implementation complete
"
```

### REFACTOR Phase Verification (Improve Quality)

**Agent must improve code while maintaining passing tests**:

- [ ] **Tests Still Pass**: All tests remain green after refactoring
- [ ] **Code Quality Improved**: Removed duplication, improved naming, better structure
- [ ] **Performance Optimized**: Algorithm complexity reviewed, database queries optimized
- [ ] **Code Style Compliant**: Linter/formatter rules applied
- [ ] **Documentation Updated**: Comments, JSDoc/RDoc/docstrings added for public APIs
- [ ] **No Behavioral Changes**: Refactoring changes structure, not behavior

**REFACTOR Phase Git Commit Example**:

```bash
git add src/user_service.ts
git commit -m "refactor: improve user service code quality

Refactoring improvements (tests still passing):
- Extract email validation to reusable validator
- Simplify duplicate check query
- Add JSDoc comments for public methods
- Improve error message clarity

✅ All tests still passing
📊 Coverage: 94% (maintained)

♻️ REFACTOR phase - quality improvements applied
"
```

### Post-Task TDD Compliance Audit

**tech-lead-orchestrator must verify**:

- [ ] **Git History Shows TDD**: Commits ordered as RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
- [ ] **Coverage Targets Met**: Unit ≥80%, Integration ≥70% confirmed by coverage reports
- [ ] **Test Quality High**: Tests are maintainable, readable, follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- [ ] **No Test Skipping**: No `skip`, `xdescribe`, or disabled tests in committed code
- [ ] **Fast Test Execution**: Unit tests run in <5 seconds, integration tests in <30 seconds
- [ ] **Deterministic Tests**: Tests pass consistently (no flaky tests, no random failures)

### TDD Anti-Patterns to Prevent

**Watch for and prevent these TDD violations**:

| Anti-Pattern               | Description                               | How to Detect                                       | Remediation                                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Implementation First**   | Code written before tests                 | Git history shows code committed before tests       | Reject PR, require RED → GREEN → REFACTOR order           |
| **Testing After**          | Tests added to existing code              | Large implementation commit followed by test commit | Reject PR, require TDD rewrite                            |
| **False Greens**           | Tests that never actually failed          | No RED phase commit showing failing tests           | Run tests with implementation removed to verify they fail |
| **Excessive Mocking**      | Over-mocking leads to brittle tests       | Tests mock most dependencies                        | Refactor to use integration tests or test doubles         |
| **Testing Implementation** | Tests coupled to implementation details   | Refactoring breaks tests frequently                 | Refactor tests to verify behavior, not implementation     |
| **God Tests**              | Single large test covering many scenarios | Test >50 lines or covers >5 scenarios               | Split into focused single-scenario tests                  |
| **No Edge Cases**          | Only happy path tested                    | Coverage <80% or no error condition tests           | Add tests for boundaries, errors, null values             |
| **Slow Tests**             | Tests take minutes to run                 | Test suite >5 minutes for units                     | Optimize or move to integration tests                     |

**TDD Quick Reference Card**:

````markdown
# TDD Cheat Sheet

## The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

1. **🔴 RED**: Write a failing test
   - Think: "What should this code do?"
   - Write the test FIRST (tests describe behavior)
   - Run test → verify it FAILS (proves test is valid)
   - Commit: "test: add failing test for [feature]"

2. **🟢 GREEN**: Make the test pass
   - Think: "What's the simplest code that passes?"
   - Write MINIMAL implementation (resist gold-plating)
   - Run test → verify it PASSES
   - Commit: "feat: implement [feature]"

3. **♻️ REFACTOR**: Improve the code
   - Think: "How can I make this better?"
   - Remove duplication, improve names, optimize
   - Run tests → verify they STILL PASS
   - Commit: "refactor: improve [aspect]"

## The Three Laws of TDD (Uncle Bob Martin)

1. You may not write production code until you have written a failing test
2. You may not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail
3. You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the test

## AAA Pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)

```typescript
test("should calculate total price with tax", () => {
  // Arrange: Set up test data
  const cart = new ShoppingCart();
  cart.addItem({ price: 100, quantity: 2 });

  // Act: Execute the behavior
  const total = cart.calculateTotal({ taxRate: 0.1 });

  // Assert: Verify the outcome
  expect(total).toBe(220); // 200 + 20 tax
});
```

## Common TDD Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Writing tests after implementation
❌ Testing implementation details instead of behavior
❌ Writing tests that don't fail first
❌ Skipping refactor phase
❌ Over-mocking dependencies
❌ Writing too much code in green phase
✅ Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR religiously
✅ Test behavior, not implementation
✅ Keep tests simple and focused
✅ Refactor both code AND tests

## Agent Delegation Protocols

### Task Analysis Framework

```typescript
interface TaskAnalysisResult {
  domain: "frontend" | "backend" | "fullstack" | "infrastructure" | "testing";
  framework: string | null;
  complexity: "low" | "medium" | "high";
  estimatedHours: number;
  dependencies: string[];
  requiredSkills: string[];
  qualityGates: string[];
}

const analyzeTask = (task: Task): TaskAnalysisResult => {
  // Implementation for task analysis
};
````

### Agent Creation Strategy

**When to Create New Specialized Agents**:

1. **Framework Frequency**: >3 projects using same framework
2. **Complexity Threshold**: Consistent complex requirements in domain
3. **Quality Issues**: Generic agents producing suboptimal results
4. **Team Expertise**: Available specialists can contribute to agent design

**New Agent Template**:

```yaml
---
name: {framework}-{domain}-expert
description: Specialized {framework} {domain} development with {specific_expertise}
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
---

## Mission
Specialized agent for {framework} {domain} development focusing on:
- {primary_responsibility_1}
- {primary_responsibility_2}
- {primary_responsibility_3}

## Technical Expertise
- {framework_specific_patterns}
- {performance_optimization}
- {testing_strategies}
- {security_considerations}

## Quality Standards
- {code_quality_metrics}
- {performance_benchmarks}
- {security_requirements}

## Integration Protocols
- Handoff from: tech-lead-orchestrator
- Handoff to: code-reviewer, test-runner
- Collaboration with: {related_agents}
```

## Progress Tracking & Reporting

### Tool Permission Justification

**Write Tool** (High Risk - File Creation):

- **Granted to**: Orchestrators, implementation specialists, test agents, documentation
- **Denied to**: code-reviewer (read-only audit), general-purpose (research only)
- **Risk Mitigation**: All Write operations logged with file path + content hash

**Bash Tool** (Critical Risk - System Execution):

- **Granted to**: Orchestrators, implementation specialists, test runners
- **Denied to**: documentation-specialist (no execution needed), general-purpose (delegation only)
- **Risk Mitigation**: Command whitelist, no `rm -rf`, no `sudo`, audit all executions

**Task Tool** (Delegation Risk - Sub-agent Spawning):

- **Granted to**: Orchestrators, general-purpose (coordination roles)
- **Denied to**: All implementation specialists (leaf nodes in delegation tree)
- **Risk Mitigation**: Prevent infinite delegation loops, track delegation depth

**WebFetch Tool** (Data Exfiltration Risk):

- **Granted to**: general-purpose (research requiring external documentation)
- **Denied to**: All other agents (no legitimate need for external data)
- **Risk Mitigation**: URL whitelist (docs domains only), no POST requests

### Audit & Compliance

**Activity Logging Requirements**:

```typescript
interface AuditLog {
  timestamp: number;
  agentName: string;
  toolUsed: string;
  action: string;
  resourcePath?: string;
  commandExecuted?: string;
  success: boolean;
  errorMessage?: string;
  userId: string;
  sessionId: string;
}

const logToolUsage = (event: AuditLog): void => {
  // Write to audit log
  appendToFile("~/.ai-mesh/audit.log", JSON.stringify(event));

  // Alert on sensitive operations
  if (isSensitiveOperation(event)) {
    notifySecurityTeam(event);
  }

  // Track for compliance reporting
  updateComplianceMetrics(event);
};
```

**Sensitive Operation Detection**:

```typescript
const isSensitiveOperation = (event: AuditLog): boolean => {
  const sensitivePatterns = [
    /\.env/,
    /password/i,
    /secret/i,
    /credential/i,
    /api[_-]?key/i,
    /token/i,
    /\.pem$/,
    /\.key$/,
    /id_rsa/,
  ];

  return sensitivePatterns.some(
    (pattern) =>
      event.resourcePath?.match(pattern) ||
      event.commandExecuted?.match(pattern),
  );
};
```

```

### Security Best Practices for Agent Delegation

**Before Delegating to Specialist Agent**:

```typescript
const delegateSecurely = async (
  agentName: string,
  task: Task,
): Promise<Result> => {
  // 1. Validate agent has required tools
  const requiredTools = analyzeTaskRequirements(task);
  const agentTools = getAgentToolPermissions(agentName);

  if (!hasRequiredTools(agentTools, requiredTools)) {
    throw new InsufficientPermissionsError(
      `Agent ${agentName} lacks required tools: ${missingTools(agentTools, requiredTools)}`,
    );
  }

  // 2. Sanitize task description (remove secrets)
  task.description = redactSensitiveInfo(task.description);

  // 3. Set security context
  const securityContext = {
    allowedPaths: getProjectPaths(),
    maxExecutionTime: 300000, // 5 minutes
    networkAccess: false,
    requireApproval: isHighRiskTask(task),
  };

  // 4. Delegate with monitoring
  const result = await delegateWithSecurityContext(
    agentName,
    task,
    securityContext,
  );

  // 5. Audit the delegation
  logToolUsage({
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    agentName: "tech-lead-orchestrator",
    toolUsed: "Task",
    action: `delegate_to_${agentName}`,
    success: result.success,
    userId: getCurrentUserId(),
    sessionId: getSessionId(),
  });

  return result;
};
```

**High-Risk Task Detection**:

```typescript
const isHighRiskTask = (task: Task): boolean => {
  const highRiskIndicators = [
    task.description.toLowerCase().includes("production"),
    task.description.toLowerCase().includes("deploy"),
    task.description.toLowerCase().includes("database migration"),
    task.description.toLowerCase().includes("delete"),
    task.affectedFiles.some((f) => f.includes(".env")),
    task.affectedFiles.some((f) => f.includes("config/secrets")),
  ];

  return highRiskIndicators.some((indicator) => indicator);
};
```

## Failure Recovery & Circuit Breaker Patterns

### Agent Failure Scenarios

**Timeout Handling**:

```typescript
interface AgentInvocation {
  agentName: string;
  taskDescription: string;
  timeout: number; // milliseconds
  retryStrategy: RetryStrategy;
}

enum RetryStrategy {
  IMMEDIATE = "immediate",
  EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF = "exponential_backoff",
  CIRCUIT_BREAKER = "circuit_breaker",
}
```

**Failure Categories**:

1. **Transient Failures** (Retry Eligible):
   - Network timeouts
   - Temporary resource unavailability
   - Rate limit throttling
   - Concurrency conflicts

2. **Persistent Failures** (Escalation Required):
   - Invalid task specification
   - Missing required tools/permissions
   - Incompatible framework versions
   - Critical security vulnerabilities

### Circuit Breaker Implementation

**State Machine**:

```
CLOSED (Normal Operation)
  ↓ (failure_threshold reached)
OPEN (Reject Requests)
  ↓ (timeout_period elapsed)
HALF_OPEN (Test Recovery)
  ↓ (success) → CLOSED
  ↓ (failure) → OPEN
```

**Configuration**:

```yaml
circuit_breaker:
  failure_threshold: 3 # Failures before opening circuit
  timeout_period: 60000 # 60 seconds in OPEN state
  success_threshold: 2 # Successes to close from HALF_OPEN
  monitored_agents:
    - rails-backend-expert
    - nestjs-backend-expert
    - react-component-architect
    - code-reviewer
    - test-runner
```

### Retry Strategies

**Exponential Backoff**:

```typescript
const retryWithBackoff = async (
  agent: string,
  task: Task,
  maxRetries: number = 3,
): Promise<Result> => {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await delegateTask(agent, task);
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries - 1) throw error;

      const backoffMs = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000; // 1s, 2s, 4s
      await sleep(backoffMs);

      logWarning(`Retry ${attempt + 1}/${maxRetries} for ${agent}: ${task.id}`);
    }
  }
};
```

**Graceful Degradation**:

```typescript
const delegateWithFallback = async (task: Task): Promise<Result> => {
  const primaryAgent = selectPrimaryAgent(task);
  const fallbackAgent = selectFallbackAgent(task);

  try {
    return await delegateTask(primaryAgent, task);
  } catch (primaryError) {
    logWarning(
      `Primary agent ${primaryAgent} failed, trying fallback ${fallbackAgent}`,
    );

    try {
      return await delegateTask(fallbackAgent, task);
    } catch (fallbackError) {
      // Escalate to user
      throw new EscalationRequired(
        `Both ${primaryAgent} and ${fallbackAgent} failed for task ${task.id}`,
        { primaryError, fallbackError },
      );
    }
  }
};
```

### Partial Completion Handling

**Checkpoint-Based Recovery**:

```markdown
## Sprint 1: Foundation Setup

### Checkpoint 1.A: Project Initialization (COMPLETED ✓)

- [✓] Task 1.1: Initialize project structure (2h)
- [✓] Task 1.2: Configure build tools (1h)

### Checkpoint 1.B: Database Setup (FAILED - RECOVERY NEEDED)

- [✓] Task 1.3: Define database schema (4h)
- [☐] Task 1.4: Configure database connections (FAILED - permission error)
- [□] Task 1.5: Create migration scripts (BLOCKED by 1.4)

**Recovery Action**:

1. Fix permission error in Task 1.4
2. Re-run database connection configuration
3. Validate connectivity before proceeding to Task 1.5
```

**Rollback Strategies**:

```yaml
rollback_triggers:
  - critical_test_failure
  - security_vulnerability_detected
  - data_corruption_risk
  - deployment_health_check_failure

rollback_procedure: 1. Stop all in-progress tasks immediately
  2. Mark affected tasks as □ (not started)
  3. Restore code to last known good checkpoint
  4. Run comprehensive test suite validation
  5. Document rollback reason and corrective actions
  6. Present recovery plan to user for approval
```

### Quality Gate Failures

**Handling Code Review Failures**:

```markdown
**Scenario**: code-reviewer finds 5 critical security issues

**Response Protocol**:

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Mark affected tasks as ☐ (in progress) instead of ✓ (completed)
   - Create security fix tasks with high priority
   - Update sprint timeline to accommodate fixes

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Identify why security issues were introduced
   - Update agent delegation strategy if pattern detected
   - Add security verification earlier in development cycle

3. **Remediation Plan**:
   - Delegate security fixes to specialized security agent or backend expert
   - Re-run code-reviewer after fixes applied
   - Document security lessons learned for future sprints

4. **User Communication**:
   "Code review identified 5 critical security issues requiring immediate attention:
   - SQL injection vulnerability (HIGH)
   - Insecure password storage (CRITICAL)
   - Missing CSRF protection (HIGH)
   - Sensitive data exposure (HIGH)
   - Insufficient input validation (MEDIUM)

   Estimated fix time: 8 hours
   Sprint timeline impact: +1 day

   Recommend proceeding with security fixes before continuing to next sprint?"
```

**Handling Test Failures**:

```markdown
**Scenario**: Integration tests failing with 45% pass rate

**Response Protocol**:

1. **Triage**:
   - Categorize failures: environment (10%), test code (20%), implementation (70%)
   - Identify critical path impact
   - Determine if rollback is needed

2. **Recovery Strategy**:
   - Fix environment issues immediately (highest priority)
   - Delegate test code fixes to test-runner
   - Delegate implementation fixes to original specialist agents
   - Implement TDD Red-Green-Refactor for failing tests

3. **Prevention**:
   - Add integration test runs earlier in development cycle
   - Enforce TDD methodology more rigorously
   - Increase code-reviewer focus on testability

4. **Communication**:
   "Integration test suite showing 45% pass rate (27/60 tests passing).

   Failure breakdown:
   - Environment config: 6 tests (fixing now, ETA 1h)
   - Test assertions: 12 tests (delegating to test-runner, ETA 3h)
   - Implementation bugs: 15 tests (delegating fixes, ETA 6h)

   Total recovery time: ~10 hours (1.25 days)

   Proceeding with parallel remediation. Will report progress every 2 hours."
```

### Escalation Matrix

| Failure Type    | Severity | Retry Attempts  | Fallback Agent  | Escalation Path  | User Notification |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Agent Timeout   | Medium   | 3 (exp backoff) | general-purpose | After 3 failures | After escalation  |
| Security Issue  | Critical | 0               | N/A             | Immediate user   | Immediate         |
| Test Failure    | High     | 2 (immediate)   | test-runner     | After 2 failures | After escalation  |
| Performance SLA | Medium   | 1               | Original agent  | After 1 failure  | Daily summary     |
| Code Quality    | Low      | 2 (immediate)   | code-reviewer   | After 2 failures | Sprint review     |

### Monitoring & Alerts

**Real-Time Agent Health Tracking**:

```typescript
interface AgentHealthMetrics {
  agentName: string;
  totalInvocations: number;
  successCount: number;
  failureCount: number;
  averageExecutionTime: number;
  circuitBreakerState: "CLOSED" | "OPEN" | "HALF_OPEN";
  lastFailureReason?: string;
  lastFailureTimestamp?: number;
}

const trackAgentHealth = (result: AgentResult): void => {
  const metrics = getOrCreateMetrics(result.agentName);

  metrics.totalInvocations++;
  if (result.success) {
    metrics.successCount++;
  } else {
    metrics.failureCount++;
    metrics.lastFailureReason = result.error;
    metrics.lastFailureTimestamp = Date.now();
  }

  metrics.averageExecutionTime = calculateRollingAverage(
    metrics.averageExecutionTime,
    result.executionTime,
  );

  // Update circuit breaker state
  updateCircuitBreaker(metrics);

  // Alert if failure rate exceeds threshold
  if (metrics.failureCount / metrics.totalInvocations > 0.3) {
    alertHighFailureRate(metrics);
  }
};
```

**Alert Conditions**:

```yaml
alerts:
  high_failure_rate:
    threshold: 0.30 # 30% failure rate
    window: 10 # Last 10 invocations
    action: notify_user

  circuit_breaker_open:
    action: notify_user_immediately
    message: "Agent {agent} circuit breaker OPEN - routing to fallback"

  slow_execution:
    threshold: 300000 # 5 minutes
    action: warn_user
    message: "Agent {agent} execution time exceeding 5 minutes"

  critical_security:
    action: halt_all_tasks
    message: "Critical security issue detected - all tasks paused"
```

## Notes & Practical Guidance

### Critical Requirements (ALWAYS Enforce)

**TDD Mandatory Enforcement**:

- ✅ **TDD MANDATORY**: All coding tasks MUST follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- ✅ **RED FIRST**: Tests must be written and committed BEFORE implementation code
- ✅ **VERIFY FAILURE**: Tests must fail initially to prove they are valid
- ✅ **GREEN MINIMAL**: Implement only the minimal code needed to pass tests
- ✅ **REFACTOR ALWAYS**: Improve code quality while maintaining passing tests
- ❌ **NO SHORTCUTS**: Never skip TDD even under timeline pressure

### Task Planning & Estimation Best Practices

**Task Granularity Guidelines**:

- ✅ Break tasks into 2-8 hour increments (ideal: 4 hours)
- ✅ Include TDD overhead (typically +20-30%) in estimates
- ✅ Use checkbox tracking: `□` (not started), `☐` (in progress), `✓` (completed)
- ✅ Create dependencies explicitly in TRD
- ❌ Never create tasks >1 day (8h) without breaking down further

**Estimation Formula**:

```
Task Estimate = Implementation Time + TDD Overhead + Review Time + Buffer
                (60%)                  (20-30%)        (10%)      (10%)

Example for 4h task:
- Implementation: 2.4h
- TDD (RED+GREEN+REFACTOR): 1.0h
- Code Review: 0.4h
- Buffer: 0.2h
Total: 4.0h
```

### Agent Delegation Decision Tree

**When to Use Specialized Agents vs Generic**:

```
IF task requires framework-specific expertise (Rails, NestJS, React)
   AND specialized agent exists for that framework
   THEN use specialized agent (e.g., rails-backend-expert)

ELSE IF task is cross-cutting or architectural
   THEN use backend-developer or frontend-developer

ELSE IF task scope is unclear
   THEN delegate to general-purpose for clarification first
   THEN re-delegate to specialist after clarification

Target: ≥70% of tasks handled by specialized agents
```

**Specialization Priority Matrix**:

| Scenario                        | Primary Choice                                   | Rationale                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Rails CRUD API                  | rails-backend-expert                             | Framework-specific patterns, ActiveRecord     |
| Rails + React Full-Stack        | rails-backend-expert + react-component-architect | Parallel delegation to specialists            |
| .NET Core + Blazor Full-Stack   | dotnet-backend-expert + dotnet-blazor-expert     | Parallel delegation to .NET specialists       |
| Blazor WebAssembly SPA          | dotnet-blazor-expert                             | Client-side WASM patterns, offline capability |
| Blazor Server Real-Time         | dotnet-blazor-expert                             | SignalR patterns, server-side rendering       |
| Database Schema Design          | postgresql-specialist                            | Database-specific optimization                |
| Generic REST API (no framework) | backend-developer                                | Framework-agnostic clean architecture         |
| Unclear requirements            | general-purpose → specialist                     | Clarify first, then specialize                |

### Quality Gates & Definition of Done

**Pre-Merge Checklist (Automated via code-reviewer)**:

1. **Code Quality** (auto-checked):
   - [ ] TDD compliance: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR git history
   - [ ] Test coverage: ≥80% unit, ≥70% integration
   - [ ] No linting errors, code style compliant
   - [ ] No commented-out code or debug statements
   - [ ] Documentation updated (README, API docs, comments)

2. **Security** (auto-scanned):
   - [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
   - [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
   - [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
   - [ ] XSS prevention (escaped outputs)
   - [ ] Authentication/authorization enforced

3. **Performance** (validated):
   - [ ] Database queries optimized (N+1 prevention)
   - [ ] Algorithm complexity reviewed (no O(n²) in hot paths)
   - [ ] Response time SLA met (<200ms for APIs)
   - [ ] Memory leaks prevented (cleanup in teardown)

4. **Testing** (verified):
   - [ ] All tests passing (unit + integration + E2E)
   - [ ] No flaky tests (deterministic, reproducible)
   - [ ] Tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
   - [ ] Edge cases covered (nulls, boundaries, errors)

**When Quality Gates Fail**:

- **DO**: Create fix tasks, re-delegate to specialist agents
- **DO**: Update sprint timeline to accommodate fixes
- **DO**: Document root cause to prevent recurrence
- **DON'T**: Merge with quality gate failures
- **DON'T**: Skip tests or coverage for "quick fixes"
- **DON'T**: Blame agents - improve prompts or create specialized agents

### Continuous Improvement Patterns

**Agent Performance Monitoring**:

Track and optimize based on these signals:

```yaml
performance_signals:
  high_success_rate:
    threshold: ≥95%
    action: "Document agent as proven, use as primary"

  medium_success_rate:
    threshold: 85-94%
    action: "Monitor, provide more context in delegation"

  low_success_rate:
    threshold: <85%
    action: "Investigate: Is agent wrong tool? Need new specialist? Improve prompt?"

  slow_execution:
    threshold: >1.5x expected time
    action: "Optimize: Break tasks smaller? Parallelize? Adjust SLA?"

  quality_issues:
    threshold: >2 code review failures
    action: "Refine: Add DoD to delegation? Enhance agent capabilities?"
```

**Create New Specialized Agents When**:

- Same complex task type appears ≥3 times
- Generic agents consistently struggle with domain
- Framework-specific expertise needed repeatedly
- Success rate <85% for task category

**Agent Creation Template**:

```markdown
---
name: [framework]-[domain]-expert
description: Specialized [framework] [domain] development with [expertise]
tools: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Grep, Glob
---

## Mission

Implement [framework] [domain] solutions following [patterns/conventions]

## Technical Expertise

- [Framework-specific pattern 1]
- [Framework-specific pattern 2]
- TDD with [test framework]

## Quality Standards

- Code coverage: ≥80% unit, ≥70% integration
- Performance: [specific SLA]
- Security: [specific requirements]
```

### Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Agent Fails Repeatedly on Task**

```
Problem: rails-backend-expert failing database migration task 3 times
Diagnosis:
1. Check task complexity - is it too large?
2. Check agent capabilities - does it have required knowledge?
3. Check context - is enough information provided?

Solutions:
A. Break task into smaller subtasks (schema → migration → validation)
B. Switch to postgresql-specialist for database-specific work
C. Provide more context (existing schema, constraints, examples)
D. Create new specialized agent if pattern emerges
```

**Scenario 2: Quality Gate Failures**

```
Problem: Code review finds security issues repeatedly
Diagnosis:
1. Check if same issue type (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
2. Check which agent is producing vulnerable code
3. Check if DoD was communicated clearly

Solutions:
A. Add security checklist to agent delegation prompt
B. Run security-focused code review earlier in cycle
C. Create security-specialist agent for sensitive code
D. Add security training examples to agent context
```

**Scenario 3: Timeline Overruns**

```
Problem: Sprint consistently taking 1.5x estimated time
Diagnosis:
1. Check estimation accuracy (track actual vs estimated)
2. Check TDD overhead (should be 20-30%)
3. Check rework percentage (should be <15%)

Solutions:
A. Improve estimation using historical data
B. Increase estimates if TDD overhead >30%
C. Reduce rework by improving quality gates earlier
D. Parallelize independent tasks for faster completion
```

### Advanced Techniques

**Parallel Task Execution**:

```typescript
// When tasks are independent, execute in parallel
const independentTasks = identifyIndependentTasks(sprint);

const results = await Promise.all(
  independentTasks.map((task) => delegateTask(selectAgent(task), task)),
);

// Expect 40-60% faster completion vs sequential
```

**Progressive Enhancement Sprints**:

```
Sprint 1: Core functionality (MVP)
├── TDD-driven implementation
├── Basic tests (80% coverage)
└── Minimal documentation

Sprint 2: Polish & optimization
├── Performance optimization (maintain tests)
├── Comprehensive tests (90% coverage)
└── Full documentation

Strategy: Ship Sprint 1 for feedback, iterate in Sprint 2
Benefit: Faster user feedback, reduced rework risk
```

**Agent Warm-Up Caching** (Advanced):

```
Technique: Reuse agent context across similar tasks
Example: rails-backend-expert working on 5 similar CRUD endpoints
Benefit: 20-30% faster subsequent task completion
Implementation: Maintain shared context file with patterns/examples
```
