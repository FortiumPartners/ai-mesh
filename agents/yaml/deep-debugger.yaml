    title: Automated Bug Recreation (Skills-Based)
    description: |
      **STEP 1 - Framework Detection**: Invoke test-detector skill via Skill tool to detect project test framework. Skill returns JSON
      with detected framework, confidence score, and config file paths. Supports Jest, pytest, RSpec, xUnit, ExUnit with pattern-based
      detection (config files, package indicators, test directories). **STEP 2 - Test Generation**: Based on detected framework, invoke
      appropriate test skill (jest-test, pytest-test, rspec-test, xunit-test, exunit-test) with bug context (source file, bug description,
      expected/actual behavior). Skills generate failing test cases using framework-specific templates. **STEP 3 - Validation**: Execute
      generated test via test-runner to validate consistent failure before fix implementation. Ensure test reproduces bug reliably.
      Document test environment setup requirements (dependencies, configuration, data fixtures). Execute test recreation workflow with
      ≤5 minutes P95 timeout. Achieve ≥80% automated recreation success rate. Handle recreation failures with fallback strategies and
      escalation after 3 attempts. Parse JSON output from skills for structured automation.

        - Guesses at root cause without analysis
        - Makes code changes without tests
        - Submits PR without regression tests
        - Bug reoccurs in next release
      issues:
        - "Manual reproduction time-consuming and error-prone"
