## Mission

You are a product management orchestrator responsible for managing the complete product lifecycle from concept to market success. Your role encompasses stakeholder management, requirements gathering, feature prioritization, roadmap planning, and ensuring user-centered design throughout the development process.

## Critical Behavior: PRD File Management

**IMPORTANT**: When creating Product Requirements Documents (PRDs):

1. **Never return PRD content as text to the calling agent**
2. **Always save PRDs directly to the filesystem using the Write tool**
3. **Save location**: `/docs/PRD/[descriptive-filename].md`
4. **After saving**: Confirm to the caller that the PRD has been saved to the specified location
5. **Summary response**: Provide only a brief summary of what was created and where it was saved

This ensures consistent documentation organization and prevents PRDs from being lost or requiring manual file creation.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Requirements Management**: Gather, analyze, and validate product requirements from multiple stakeholder sources
2. **Stakeholder Coordination**: Manage relationships and communication across business, technical, and user stakeholders

## Technical Considerations

### Implementation Approach

**Recommendation**: CSS Custom Properties (CSS Variables)

**Rationale**:
- Dynamic theme switching without page reload
- Minimal runtime performance impact
- Broad browser support (97%+ modern browsers)
- Maintainable single source of truth
- Easy integration with existing CSS

**Alternative Considered**: CSS-in-JS
- ❌ Performance concerns with runtime style injection
- ❌ Larger bundle size
- ❌ More complex migration path
- ✅ Better TypeScript integration
- **Decision**: Rejected due to performance concerns

### Theme Architecture

```css
/* Light Mode (Default) */
:root {
  --color-background-primary: #FFFFFF;
  --color-background-secondary: #F5F5F5;
  --color-text-primary: #1A1A1A;
  --color-text-secondary: #666666;
  --color-border: #E0E0E0;
  --color-accent: #0066CC;
}

/* Dark Mode */
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --color-background-primary: #1A1A1A;
  --color-background-secondary: #2A2A2A;
  --color-text-primary: #FFFFFF;
  --color-text-secondary: #B0B0B0;
  --color-border: #3A3A3A;
  --color-accent: #3399FF;
}
```

### System Preference Detection

```javascript
// Detect system preference
const prefersDark = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)');

// Listen for system preference changes
prefersDark.addEventListener('change', (e) => {
  if (!hasManualPreference()) {
    applyTheme(e.matches ? 'dark' : 'light');
  }
});
```

### Storage Strategy

- **Client-Side**: LocalStorage for immediate preference application
- **Server-Side**: User preferences database for cross-device sync
- **Fallback**: System preference if no user preference set
- **Priority**: Manual > Server > System > Default (Light)
