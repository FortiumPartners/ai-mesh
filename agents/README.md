- **Tier 2**: Domain specialists (infrastructure-specialist, postgresql-specialist, code-reviewer)
- **Tier 3**: Strategic orchestrators (ai-mesh-orchestrator, tech-lead-orchestrator, product-management-orchestrator)

### Overlap Prevention
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each agent has explicit responsibility boundaries
- **Delegation Rules**: Specific criteria for when to delegate vs retain
- **Conflict Resolution**: ai-mesh-orchestrator arbitrates overlapping claims
- **Performance Monitoring**: agent-meta-engineer tracks and optimizes assignments

## Quality Standards

### Agent Documentation Requirements
- **Mission Statement**: Clear, specific purpose and boundaries
- **Tool Permissions**: Minimal required tools with explicit justification
- **Integration Protocols**: Defined handoff and collaboration contracts
- **Quality Standards**: Measurable success criteria and performance metrics
- **Delegation Criteria**: When to delegate vs when to retain ownership

### File Creation Requirements
- **product-management-orchestrator**: MUST save all PRDs to @docs/PRD/ using Write tool
- **tech-lead-orchestrator**: MUST save all TRDs to @docs/TRD/ using Write tool
- **documentation-specialist**: Creates technical docs, runbooks, user guides (NOT PRDs/TRDs/APIs)
- **api-documentation-specialist**: Creates OpenAPI specs, REST API docs, client SDK documentation
- **All agents**: Never return document content as text - always save to files

### Ecosystem Health Metrics  
- **Zero Overlap**: No duplicated functionality between agents
- **Complete Coverage**: All common workflows have appropriate automation
- **High Performance**: >95% agent success rates
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback and high adoption rates
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular optimization based on usage patterns

## Evolution & Improvement

### Agent Lifecycle Management
- **Pattern Recognition**: 3+ similar requests trigger new agent consideration
- **Performance Monitoring**: <80% success rate triggers improvement process
- **Usage Analysis**: Track delegation patterns and optimization opportunities
- **Ecosystem Evolution**: Continuous refinement based on real-world usage

### Next Steps
1. **Validate Architecture**: Test complete development project flow with skills-based agents
2. **Performance Baseline**: Establish success rate and efficiency metrics (target: 98.2% framework detection)
3. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback on agent effectiveness and UX (target: >90% satisfaction)
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Refine agents and skills based on real-world usage patterns
5. **Skill Expansion**: Add new framework skills as patterns emerge (e.g., Vue, Angular, Django)
