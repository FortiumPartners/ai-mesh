```

### Specialist Delegation Logic

#### Infrastructure & DevOps
```
IF strategic infrastructure coordination → infrastructure-orchestrator
ELSE IF production AWS/Kubernetes/Docker automation → infrastructure-management-subagent
ELSE IF legacy infrastructure management → infrastructure-subagent
ELSE IF PostgreSQL database work → postgresql-specialist
ELSE IF Kubernetes packaging/Helm → helm-chart-specialist
ELSE IF deployment/release automation → deployment-orchestrator
```

#### Backend Development
```
# Framework Detection (Automatic)
IF (Gemfile exists AND rails gem present) → rails-backend-expert
ELSE IF (package.json exists AND @nestjs/core dependency) → nestjs-backend-expert
ELSE IF (mix.exs exists AND phoenix dependency ≥1.7) → elixir-phoenix-expert
ELSE → backend-developer (framework-agnostic)

# Explicit Framework Mention
IF task mentions "Rails" OR "ActiveRecord" OR "Sidekiq" → rails-backend-expert
ELSE IF task mentions "NestJS" OR "TypeScript backend" → nestjs-backend-expert
ELSE IF task mentions "Elixir" OR "Phoenix" OR "LiveView" OR "OTP" OR "Ecto" → elixir-phoenix-expert
ELSE → backend-developer

# Specialist Hierarchy (Delegation Priority)
1. Framework-Specific Experts (Rails/NestJS/Elixir) - Highest priority for framework tasks
2. backend-developer - General backend tasks, multiple frameworks, or unclear framework
3. Escalate to human - Complex architecture, multiple frameworks requiring integration
```

#### Frontend Development
```
IF framework = React AND complexity = high → react-component-architect
ELSE IF any framework AND (accessibility OR performance) → frontend-developer
ELSE → frontend-developer (framework-agnostic)
```

#### Documentation & Quality
```
IF OpenAPI/REST API documentation → api-documentation-specialist
ELSE IF technical docs/runbooks/user guides → documentation-specialist
ELSE IF quality strategy/testing frameworks → qa-orchestrator
ELSE IF CI/CD pipeline work → build-orchestrator
```

## Tool Permission Matrix

## Integration Protocols

### Quality Gate Enforcement
1. **Development** → **code-reviewer** (security/performance validation)
2. **Code Review Pass** → **test-runner** (unit/integration tests)  
3. **Tests Pass** → **playwright-tester** (E2E validation)
4. **All Tests Pass** → **git-workflow** (conventional commits & PR)

### Handoff Contracts
All agents must provide:
- **Clear Context**: Complete task requirements and constraints
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes and validation requirements
- **Integration Points**: Dependencies and collaboration requirements
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure modes and recovery procedures

## Agent Capability Matrix

### Specialization Hierarchy
- **Tier 1**: Framework-specific experts (rails-backend-expert, react-component-architect)
- **Tier 2**: Domain generalists (backend-developer, frontend-developer)  
- **Tier 3**: Cross-domain coordinators (ai-mesh-orchestrator, tech-lead-orchestrator)

### Overlap Prevention
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each agent has explicit responsibility boundaries
- **Delegation Rules**: Specific criteria for when to delegate vs retain
- **Conflict Resolution**: ai-mesh-orchestrator arbitrates overlapping claims
- **Performance Monitoring**: agent-meta-engineer tracks and optimizes assignments

## Quality Standards

### Agent Documentation Requirements
- **Mission Statement**: Clear, specific purpose and boundaries
- **Tool Permissions**: Minimal required tools with explicit justification
- **Integration Protocols**: Defined handoff and collaboration contracts
- **Quality Standards**: Measurable success criteria and performance metrics
- **Delegation Criteria**: When to delegate vs when to retain ownership

### File Creation Requirements
- **product-management-orchestrator**: MUST save all PRDs to @docs/PRD/ using Write tool
- **tech-lead-orchestrator**: MUST save all TRDs to @docs/TRD/ using Write tool
- **documentation-specialist**: Creates technical docs, runbooks, user guides (NOT PRDs/TRDs/APIs)
- **api-documentation-specialist**: Creates OpenAPI specs, REST API docs, client SDK documentation
- **All agents**: Never return document content as text - always save to files

### Ecosystem Health Metrics  
- **Zero Overlap**: No duplicated functionality between agents
- **Complete Coverage**: All common workflows have appropriate automation
- **High Performance**: >95% agent success rates
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback and high adoption rates
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular optimization based on usage patterns

## Evolution & Improvement

### Agent Lifecycle Management
- **Pattern Recognition**: 3+ similar requests trigger new agent consideration
- **Performance Monitoring**: <80% success rate triggers improvement process
- **Usage Analysis**: Track delegation patterns and optimization opportunities
- **Ecosystem Evolution**: Continuous refinement based on real-world usage

### Next Steps
1. **Validate Architecture**: Test complete development project flow
2. **Performance Baseline**: Establish success rate and efficiency metrics
3. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback on agent effectiveness and UX
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Refine agents based on real-world usage patterns
5. **Specialized Agent Creation**: Add framework specialists as patterns emerge
