# Meta-Agent Orchestration Tests

> Test scenarios for enhanced meta-agent delegation and conflict resolution

## Test Scenario 1: Simple Task Delegation

**Test Case**: Frontend component creation  
**Input**: "Create a user profile card component with avatar and contact info"  
**Expected Delegation**: frontend-developer (single agent)  
**Validation**: Task routed correctly without coordination overhead  

## Test Scenario 2: Specialized Framework Task

**Test Case**: React component with hooks  
**Input**: "Create React component with useState and useEffect for data fetching"  
**Expected Delegation**: react-component-architect (specialized over general frontend)  
**Validation**: Specialization priority rule applied correctly  

## Test Scenario 3: Multi-Agent Coordination

**Test Case**: Full-stack feature implementation  
**Input**: "Implement user registration with email verification"  
**Expected Delegation**: 
- PRIMARY: backend-developer (API endpoints)
- SUPPORTING: frontend-developer (registration form)  
- VALIDATION: test-runner (unit tests) + playwright-tester (E2E flow)
- QUALITY: code-reviewer (security review)
**Validation**: Proper coordination protocol with handoff points

## Test Scenario 4: Conflict Resolution - Overlapping Expertise

**Situation**: Both frontend-developer and react-component-architect can handle React task  
**Input**: "Build React dashboard with state management"  
**Expected Resolution**: Specialization Priority â†’ react-component-architect  
**Validation**: More specialized agent chosen correctly

## Test Scenario 5: Conflict Resolution - Quality Standards Disagreement

**Situation**: code-reviewer demands refactoring, user needs quick delivery  
**Input**: Working code with technical debt, tight deadline  
**Expected Resolution**: 
- Prioritize critical security/performance issues
- Defer non-critical improvements  
- Create technical debt tickets
**Validation**: Balanced approach applied with documentation

## Test Scenario 6: Resource Contention

**Situation**: Multiple agents need to modify same files simultaneously  
**Input**: "Update API and frontend for new feature, plus add tests"  
**Expected Resolution**: Sequential Handoff strategy  
- backend-developer (API changes)
- frontend-developer (UI updates)  
- test-runner (comprehensive tests)
- code-reviewer (quality gate)
**Validation**: Ordered execution prevents conflicts

## Test Scenario 7: Agent Performance Monitoring

**Test Case**: Workload balancing across agents  
**Monitoring**: Track task distribution over time  
**Expected Outcome**: Balanced utilization across agent mesh  
**Validation**: No single agent overwhelmed, capabilities utilized optimally

## Test Scenario 8: Escalation Protocol

**Situation**: Agents disagree on technical approach  
**Input**: backend-developer suggests REST API, frontend-developer prefers GraphQL  
**Expected Resolution**: Meta-agent decision based on:
- Project requirements and constraints
- Team expertise and preferences  
- Performance and maintenance considerations
**Validation**: Clear decision with documented rationale

## Success Metrics Validation

### Delegation Accuracy (Target: >95%)
- Track correct agent selection for 100 diverse tasks
- Measure specialization priority application
- Validate complexity assessment accuracy

### Conflict Resolution (Target: <24 hours)
- Time from conflict detection to resolution
- Quality of resolution outcomes
- Team satisfaction with arbitration decisions

### Quality Consistency (Target: 100% DoD compliance)
- All outputs pass code-reviewer validation
- Integration between agents maintains standards
- Documentation completeness across handoffs

### Agent Utilization (Target: Balanced distribution)
- Monitor task distribution across agents
- Prevent bottlenecks and underutilization
- Optimize delegation patterns based on performance

### Integration Success (Target: Seamless handoffs)
- Validate handoff protocols between agents
- Measure coordination overhead
- Track successful multi-agent project completion

## Automated Testing Implementation
