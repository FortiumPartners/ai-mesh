**Priority**: P1  
**Reported**: 2025-10-10 14:32 UTC  
**Resolved**: 2025-10-11 09:15 UTC  
**Resolution Time**: 18h 43m

## Description

Users attempting to authenticate with email-based OTP are experiencing token expiration errors. The OTP code delivered via email has already expired by the time users attempt to use it, resulting in "Invalid or expired token" errors and authentication failures.

**Impact**:
- **User Impact**: ~15% of MFA users (approximately 450 users) affected
- **Business Impact**: Users unable to access accounts, increased support tickets
- **Frequency**: Occurring on average every 30 OTP deliveries

## Environment

- **Environment**: Production
- **Component**: Authentication Service v2.4.1
- **Browser**: All browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS us-east-1, Kubernetes cluster prod-01

## Reproduction Steps

1. **Navigate** to login page: https://app.example.com/login
2. **Enter** valid credentials: user@example.com / password
3. **Select** "Send OTP via Email" for MFA
4. **Wait** for email to arrive (typically 2-5 minutes)
5. **Copy** OTP code from email
6. **Enter** OTP code in authentication form
7. **Submit** authentication request

**Observed**: "Invalid or expired token. Please request a new code." error message

**Expected**: Successful authentication and redirect to dashboard

**Frequency**: Occurs in ~15% of attempts during peak hours (9am-11am EST)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Timeline

**Phase 1: Initial Analysis (2025-10-10 14:45 - 15:30)**
- Reviewed authentication service logs
- Identified pattern: OTP expiration time = 60 seconds
- Observed email delivery delays: 45-120 seconds during peak hours

**Phase 2: Email Queue Analysis (2025-10-10 15:30 - 17:00)**
- Investigated SendGrid API integration
- Discovered email queue delays during high-volume periods
- Identified bottleneck: Single-threaded email worker process

**Phase 3: Token Lifetime Analysis (2025-10-10 17:00 - 18:00)**
- Reviewed OTP token generation logic
- Confirmed hardcoded 60-second expiration
- Calculated: Generation → Queue → Delivery → User Action = typically 90-120 seconds
- Conclusion: Token expires before user can realistically use it

### Root Cause

**Primary Cause**: OTP token expiration time (60 seconds) is too short given email delivery latency (45-120 seconds during peak hours).

**Contributing Factors**:
1. **Email Queue Delay**: Single-threaded email worker causes queue buildup during peak hours
2. **No Retry Logic**: Failed OTP attempts don't trigger automatic retry with fresh token
3. **Insufficient Monitoring**: No alerting on high OTP validation failure rates

### Root Cause Category
**Process Issue**: Insufficient consideration of email delivery latency during OTP lifetime design

### 5 Whys Analysis

1. **Why did authentication fail?**  
   → OTP token was expired when user attempted to validate it

2. **Why was the token expired?**  
   → Token lifetime is 60 seconds, but user received email after 47 seconds, leaving only 13 seconds to act

3. **Why does email delivery take 47+ seconds?**  
   → Email queue has delays during peak hours due to single-threaded worker

4. **Why is there a single-threaded email worker?**  
   → Initial implementation used simple synchronous email sending without considering scale

5. **Why wasn't this caught in testing?**  
   → Performance testing didn't simulate realistic email delivery delays under load

## Resolution

### Fix Implementation

**Changes Made**:

1. **Increased OTP Lifetime** (authentication-service)
   ```javascript
   // Before
   const OTP_EXPIRATION_SECONDS = 60;
   
   // After
   const OTP_EXPIRATION_SECONDS = 300; // 5 minutes
   ```

2. **Parallel Email Worker** (email-service)
   ```javascript
   // Implemented worker pool with 5 concurrent workers
   const emailWorkerPool = new WorkerPool({
     workers: 5,
     queueName: 'otp-emails',
     concurrency: 10
   });
   ```

3. **Retry Logic** (authentication-service)
   ```javascript
   // Added automatic retry with fresh token on expiration
   if (validationResult.error === 'expired') {
     const newToken = await generateOTP(userId);
     await sendOTPEmail(user.email, newToken);
     return { status: 'retry', message: 'Token expired. New code sent.' };
   }
   ```

4. **Monitoring & Alerting** (observability)
   ```yaml
   # Added Prometheus alert
   - alert: HighOTPFailureRate
     expr: rate(otp_validation_failures[5m]) > 0.1
     annotations:
       summary: "High OTP validation failure rate detected"
   ```

### Deployment

- **Deployed**: 2025-10-11 09:00 UTC
- **Environment**: Production (gradual rollout: 10% → 50% → 100%)
- **Validation**: Monitored OTP validation failure rate for 4 hours
- **Result**: Failure rate dropped from 15% to <1%

## Verification & Testing

### Verification Steps

1. **Unit Tests Added**:
   - Test OTP token validation with various expiration scenarios
   - Test retry logic on token expiration
   - Test worker pool concurrency and queue processing

2. **Integration Tests Added**:
   - Test complete OTP flow with realistic email delivery delays (mock 60s delay)
   - Test peak load scenarios with high email volume
   - Test monitoring and alerting triggers

3. **Production Validation**:
   - Monitored OTP validation success rate: 99.2% (vs 85% before)
   - Monitored email delivery times: P95 < 30s (vs P95 120s before)
   - Monitored user support tickets: 95% reduction in OTP-related issues

### Regression Prevention

- **Added to automated test suite**: E2E test simulating slow email delivery
- **Added performance monitoring**: Alert on P95 email delivery > 45 seconds
- **Updated test strategy**: Include realistic third-party service delays in performance testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Flaky Tests Causing CI/CD Failures

**Symptoms**:
- Tests pass locally but fail in CI/CD
- Intermittent test failures without code changes
- Random timeouts or assertion failures

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Identify flaky tests
npm run test:flaky-detector

# Run test multiple times to reproduce
for i in {1..50}; do npm test -- --testNamePattern="Authentication" || echo "FAILED: $i"; done

# Check CI/CD logs for patterns
grep -r "ECONNREFUSED\|Timeout\|Unexpected" .github/workflows/logs/
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Add Explicit Waits**: Replace implicit waits with explicit conditions
2. **Increase Timeouts**: Adjust timeouts for slower CI/CD environments
3. **Isolate Tests**: Ensure tests don't share state or depend on execution order
4. **Mock External Services**: Use deterministic mocks instead of real external services

#### Issue 2: Low Test Coverage Despite Many Tests

**Symptoms**:
- Coverage reports show <90% despite many tests written
- Critical code paths untested
- Coverage not improving despite new tests

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Generate detailed coverage report
npm test -- --coverage --coverageReporters=html lcov text

# Identify uncovered files and lines
npx nyc report --reporter=html
open coverage/index.html

# Check for missing test files
find src/ -name "*.js" ! -path "*/node_modules/*" | while read file; do
  test_file="${file%.js}.test.js"
  [ -f "$test_file" ] || echo "Missing test: $test_file for $file"
done
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Focus on Untested Code**: Target specific uncovered files and functions
2. **Add Branch Coverage**: Test all conditional branches and error paths
3. **Integration Tests**: Add integration tests for complex interactions
4. **Review Coverage Config**: Ensure coverage tool includes all source files

#### Issue 3: Defects Escaping to Production

**Symptoms**:
- Defects found in production that should have been caught in testing
- User-reported issues that weren't in test scenarios
- Quality gates passed but defects still occurred

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Analyze production defects
grep -r "ERROR\|FATAL" /var/log/production/*.log

# Compare with test scenarios
# Check if defect scenarios exist in test suite
grep -r "test.*authentication.*failure" tests/

# Review quality gate results
cat .github/workflows/quality-report.json
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Enhance Test Scenarios**: Add missing edge cases and error scenarios to test suite
2. **Production Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive production monitoring and alerting
3. **Post-Mortem Analysis**: Conduct root cause analysis and add regression tests
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Incorporate user-reported issues into test scenarios
