# Task 9.2: End-to-End Testing Automation

## Agent Assignment
**Primary**: playwright-tester  
**Duration**: 10 hours  
**Sprint**: 9 (Testing & Quality Assurance)

## Task Context
Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing automation for the External Metrics Web Service using Playwright. This task focuses on validating critical user workflows and real-time features to ensure the system meets all functional requirements.

## Technical Requirements

### Testing Framework Setup
- Playwright with TypeScript support
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile device testing capabilities
- Test data management and cleanup
- Screenshot and video recording for test failures

### Test Coverage Requirements

#### 1. User Authentication Flow Tests
- User login with email/password
- SSO authentication (Google, Azure AD, Okta)
- Multi-tenant login validation
- Session management and timeout
- Password reset functionality
- User profile management

#### 2. Dashboard Functionality Testing
- Dashboard loading and responsiveness
- Widget rendering and data display
- Real-time metric updates
- Dashboard customization (drag-and-drop)
- Chart interactions and data filtering
- Mobile responsive behavior

#### 3. Real-time WebSocket Features Testing
- WebSocket connection establishment
- Live metrics streaming validation
- Real-time notifications
- Connection resilience (reconnection on failure)
- Multi-user collaborative features
- Live activity feeds

#### 4. Admin Interface Testing
- Tenant management operations
- User role assignment and validation
- System monitoring dashboard
- Configuration management
- Bulk operations and data export

### Performance Validation
- Page load times (<2 seconds)
- API response times (<500ms)
- WebSocket latency (<100ms)
- Large dataset handling
- Concurrent user simulation

### Cross-Platform Testing
- Browser compatibility validation
- Mobile device responsiveness
- Tablet optimization
- Different screen resolutions
- Touch interface validation
