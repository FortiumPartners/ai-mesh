## Testing Tools and Setup

### Automated Testing Tools
```javascript
// Cross-browser testing with Playwright
import { test, devices } from '@playwright/test';

const browsers = ['chromium', 'firefox', 'webkit'];
const mobileDevices = [devices['iPhone 12'], devices['Pixel 5']];

test.describe('Cross-browser UAT', () => {
  browsers.forEach(browser => {
    test(`Dashboard functionality on ${browser}`, async ({ page }) => {
      // Test core dashboard functionality across browsers
    });
  });
  
  mobileDevices.forEach(device => {
    test(`Mobile experience on ${device.name}`, async ({ page }) => {
      // Test mobile-specific functionality
    });
  });
});
```

### Accessibility Testing
```javascript
// Automated accessibility testing with axe-core
import { injectAxe, checkA11y } from 'axe-playwright';

test('Accessibility compliance', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/dashboard');
  await injectAxe(page);
  await checkA11y(page, null, {
    detailedReport: true,
    detailedReportOptions: { html: true }
  });
});
```
