Resolution:
1. Check JWT token expiration settings
2. Verify Redis cluster health
3. Review session middleware configuration
```

#### Performance Issues
**Slow Dashboard Loading**:
```
Symptom: Dashboard takes >5 seconds to load
Diagnosis: Check database query performance
Resolution:
1. Review slow query logs
2. Analyze database connection pool utilization
3. Check Redis cache hit rates
4. Consider materialized view refresh
```

**High API Latency**:
```
Symptom: API responses >1 second
Diagnosis: Database or external service bottleneck
Resolution:
1. Check database query execution plans
2. Review external service response times
3. Analyze application metrics
