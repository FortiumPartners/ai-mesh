**Purpose**: Inject version-specific docs and examples directly into prompts
**Reduces**: API/versioning errors through authoritative vendor documentation
**Setup**: `claude mcp add context7 --scope user -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest`

#### Playwright MCP - Browser Automation & E2E Testing

**Purpose**: Browser automation and E2E testing as callable tools from agents  
**Capabilities**: Cross-browser testing, visual regression, performance metrics
**Setup**: `claude mcp add playwright --scope user -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest`

#### Linear/Jira - Vendor-Neutral Ticketing

**Purpose**: Connect preferred tracker through MCP servers
**Integration**: Status updates, requirement linking, artifact attachment
**Setup**: Various based on vendor (Linear, Atlassian, etc.)

### MCP Integration Patterns

- **Context7**: Auto-invoked by context-fetcher for vendor documentation
- **Playwright**: Used by playwright-tester for E2E test execution
- **Ticketing**: Updated throughout workflow for status and artifact tracking

### Authentication & Activity Tracking

#### Real-Time Activity Feed Integration

The hooks system now includes comprehensive user authentication for accurate activity tracking:

```bash
# Get your authentication token (simple)
node hooks/get-auth-token.js

# View your complete profile
node hooks/user-profile.js show

# Update your profile
node hooks/user-profile.js update --name="New Name" --email="new@email.com"

# Reset and recreate profile
node hooks/user-profile.js reset
```

#### Backend Integration (Optional)

For teams using the External Metrics Web Service:

```bash
# Set the backend URL for hook integration
export METRICS_API_URL=http://localhost:3002/api/v1

# Your authentication token is automatically used from ~/.ai-mesh/profile/user.json
# Activities will appear in the Real-Time Activity Feed with proper user attribution
```

**Activity Data Includes:**
- User identification (name, email, unique ID)
- Tool execution metrics (performance, success/failure)
- Agent invocations (subagent type, task descriptions)
- File operations (paths, changes, line counts)
- Session tracking (duration, productivity scores)

## Standard Development Workflow (Leo's Process)

### From Ticket to Merge - Complete Flow

#### Step 1: Planning & Scope (`/plan`)

```
Input: Ticket ID + constraints + goal + context
Flow: AI Mesh Orchestrator → tech-lead-orchestrator + context-fetcher
Output: Clear TRD with acceptance criteria and task breakdown
```

#### Step 2: Create/Update Ticket

```
Flow: Update ticket via Ticketing MCP with TRD, criteria, and links
Validation: Status, assignee, labels, concrete testable ACs
```

#### Step 3: Implementation (`/build`)

```
Flow: git-workflow → implement incrementally → test-runner after each step
Strategy: Part A (API/schema) → Part B (service) → Part C (UI)
Output: Unit and integration tests passing, idiomatic code
```

#### Step 4: E2E Testing (`/test e2e`)

```
Flow: playwright-tester generates/updates specs, runs with traces
Validation: Covers acceptance criteria, stable selectors, auth helpers
Output: Green E2E suite with artifacts for debugging
```

#### Step 5: Quality Gate (`/review`)

```
Flow: code-reviewer enforces DoD (security, performance, maintainability)
Requirements: All high-severity findings addressed, tests still green
Output: Security validated, performance checked, patches applied
```

#### Step 6: Documentation & PR (`/document`)

```
Flow: git-workflow creates PR + documentation-specialist updates docs
Output: CHANGELOG, migration notes, clear PR with TRD summary
```

#### Step 7: Merge & Close

```
Flow: Ticketing MCP updates status, work-completion-summary for stakeholders
Result: Ticket closed, PR merged, documentation updated, tests green on CI
```

### Quality Gates (Definition of Done)

An item is **Done** only when ALL are true:

- [ ] **Scope**: TRD updated; acceptance criteria satisfied (unit/integration/E2E)
- [ ] **Code**: Reviewed by code-reviewer; no high-severity findings remain
- [ ] **Security**: Inputs validated; secrets/config safe; authZ/authN rules enforced
- [ ] **Performance**: Meets perf budget or accepted trade-off documented

**Prerequisites**: macOS/Linux, Node 18+, Git, Claude Code installed

#### 1. MCP Server Setup (Optional - enhances functionality)

```bash
# Install recommended MCP servers
claude mcp add context7 --scope user -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest
claude mcp add playwright --scope user -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest
claude mcp add linear --scope user -- npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.linear.app/sse

# Verify installation
claude mcp list
```

#### 2. Deploy Sub-Agent Mesh (Professional NPM Installation)

```bash
# Option 1: NPM-based installation (Recommended)
npx @fortium/claude-installer install --global

# Option 2: Local project installation
npx @fortium/claude-installer install --local

# Option 3: Legacy bash installation
git clone https://github.com/FortiumPartners/claude-config.git && cd claude-config
./install.sh

# NPM Installation Features:
# 1. Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)
# 2. Interactive scope selection (global/local)
# 3. Automatic dependency management
# 4. Progress tracking with detailed logging
# 5. Comprehensive validation and health checks
# 6. Rollback capabilities and error recovery
# 7. Professional CLI with colored output

# claude-installer validate           # Validate installation
# claude-installer update             # Update existing installation
# claude-installer --help             # Show help and options
```

#### 3. User Authentication Setup (Required for Activity Tracking)

```bash
# Set up your developer profile for metrics and activity tracking
cd ~/.claude  # or your local installation directory

# Option 1: Quick setup with current git config (Recommended)
node hooks/user-profile.js

# Option 2: Custom setup with your details
node hooks/user-profile.js setup --email="your@company.com" --name="Your Name"

# Option 3: Organization-specific setup
node hooks/user-profile.js setup --email="your@company.com" --name="Your Name" --org="your-org-id"

# Verify your profile and get your auth token
node hooks/user-profile.js show

# Quick way to get just your auth token
node hooks/get-auth-token.js
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a unique user ID and secure authentication token
- Enables proper attribution in Real-Time Activity Feed
- Allows productivity metrics to be tracked per developer
- Auto-detects name/email from git config if not specified

#### 4. Post-Installation Verification

```bash
# Installation automatically validates, but for manual verification:

# Global installation check:
ls ~/.claude/agents/ ~/.claude/commands/

# Local installation check:
ls .claude/agents/ .claude/commands/

# Verify user profile exists:
ls ~/.ai-mesh/profile/user.json

# Restart Claude Code to load new configuration
# Test commands:
# /plan-product "describe your product idea"
# /analyze-product
# /create-trd @docs/PRD/your-product.md
# /implement-trd @docs/TRD/your-product-trd.md
# /fold-prompt
```

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Deployment and testing integration
- **Monitoring Tools**: Performance and health check integration
- **Communication**: Slack, Teams, and email notification workflows

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Issues

#### Authentication & Activity Tracking
- **No Activities in Feed**: Check if user profile exists (`node hooks/user-profile.js show`)
- **Wrong User Attribution**: Update profile (`node hooks/user-profile.js update --email="correct@email.com"`)
- **Hook Performance Issues**: Hooks fall back to local storage if backend unavailable (expected behavior)
- **Missing Backend Connection**: Set `METRICS_API_URL=http://localhost:3002/api/v1` for Real-Time Feed integration

#### MCP & System Integration
- **MCP Auth Issues**: Follow vendor OAuth flows; re-add servers if tokens expire
- **Commands Not Visible**: Restart Claude Code; verify MCP servers listed
- **Agent Permission Errors**: Keep tool permissions minimal; grant Bash/MCP tools only when needed
- **Process Improvement**: Use meta-agent to refactor prompts when patterns emerge

#### Quick Fixes
```bash
# Reset user authentication
node hooks/user-profile.js reset

# Check hook performance
node hooks/tool-metrics.js Read '{"file_path": "/tmp/test.txt"}' true

# Verify installation
ls ~/.ai-mesh/profile/user.json
ls ~/.claude/agents/
```

### Agent Orchestration Best Practices

- **Minimal Tools**: Start with Read/Edit; add Bash/MCP tools only when required
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each agent has explicit mission and handoff contracts
- **Continuous Improvement**: Evolve agent prompts based on usage patterns
- **Quality Gates**: Enforce DoD through code-reviewer before any PR merge
