## Core Components

### ðŸ¤– Agents Directory
**Purpose**: Custom AI agents tailored for specific development domains
- **Specialized Subagents**: Domain-specific AI assistants (frontend, backend, testing, security)
- **Workflow Orchestrators**: Multi-step automation coordinators
- **Quality Gates**: Automated review and validation agents
- **Integration Agents**: Cross-system communication and data flow

### âš¡ Commands Directory
**Purpose**: Pre-built, optimized command workflows for common development tasks

**Current Commands**:
- `fold-prompt.md`: Project analysis and CLAUDE.md optimization workflow
- `playwright-test.md`: Automated application testing and error resolution

**Command Categories** (Planned):
- **Analysis**: Code review, performance analysis, security audits
- **Generation**: Boilerplate creation, documentation generation
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E validation
- **Deployment**: CI/CD integration, environment management
- **Optimization**: Performance tuning, bundle analysis

### ðŸŽ£ Hooks Directory
**Purpose**: Event-driven automation for development lifecycle integration
- **Pre-commit**: Code quality validation, security scanning
- **Post-deployment**: Health checks, performance monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Automatic issue detection and resolution workflows
- **Productivity**: Time tracking, workflow optimization, reporting

## Configuration Standards

### Command Structure
```markdown
# Command Name
**Purpose**: Clear description of command objective
**Trigger**: When to use this command
**Prerequisites**: Required setup or dependencies
**Workflow**: Step-by-step execution process
**Output**: Expected results and artifacts
**Integration**: How it connects with other tools/workflows
```

### Agent Configuration
```yaml
agent_name:
  purpose: "Specific domain expertise"
  capabilities: ["list", "of", "core", "functions"]
  integration_points: ["claude_code", "external_tools"]
  performance_metrics: ["measurable", "outcomes"]
```

### Hook Specifications
```yaml
hook_name:
  trigger_event: "specific_lifecycle_event"
  execution_context: "when_and_where_to_run"
  dependencies: ["required", "tools", "or", "services"]
  success_criteria: "measurable_outcome"
```

## Development Workflow

### Git Operations
- **Primary Branch**: `main` (protected, requires PR review)
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/command-name` or `feature/agent-name`
- **Commit Convention**: Conventional commits with productivity impact metrics
