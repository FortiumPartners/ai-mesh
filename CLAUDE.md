## Leo's Command & Delegation System

### Core Commands

**See `agents/README.md` for complete command documentation and delegation flows.**

Key commands:
- `/create-prd` → Product Requirements Document creation via product-management-orchestrator
- `/create-trd` → Technical Requirements Document creation via tech-lead-orchestrator
- `/implement-trd` → Complete TRD implementation with approval workflows
- `/fold-prompt` → Project optimization and documentation enhancement
- `/dashboard` → Real-time productivity metrics and analytics

#### Legacy Commands (Available but superseded):

- `/plan` → Planning & Requirements (use `/plan-product` instead)
- `/build` → Implementation Loop (use `/execute-tasks` instead)
- `/test e2e` → End-to-End Testing (integrated in `/execute-tasks`)
- `/review` → Quality Gate (automated in workflow)
- `/document` → Documentation (automated in workflow)

### Agent Mesh Architecture

#### Core Orchestration Layer

- **AI Mesh Orchestrator**: Agent mesh coordinator; routes tasks and manages handoffs
- **general-purpose**: Handles ambiguous scope; routes to specialists
- **context-fetcher**: Pulls authoritative references (AgentOS, Context7)

#### Development Specialists

- **tech-lead-orchestrator**: Product → technical planning with risk assessment
- **frontend-developer**: Framework-agnostic UI with accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- **backend-developer**: Server-side with clean architecture boundaries
- **code-reviewer**: Security/quality DoD enforcement before PR
- **test-runner**: Unit/integration execution with intelligent failure triage
- **playwright-tester**: E2E testing with Playwright MCP integration

#### Framework Specialists (Expandable)

- **file-creator**: Template-based file generation with project conventions
- **directory-monitor**: Automated change detection and workflow triggering

## MCP Server Integration

### Required MCP Servers (Leo's Process)

#### Context7 - Versioned Documentation

**Purpose**: Inject version-specific docs and examples directly into prompts
**Reduces**: API/versioning errors through authoritative vendor documentation
**Setup**: `claude mcp add context7 --scope user -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest`

#### Playwright MCP - Browser Automation & E2E Testing

**Purpose**: Browser automation and E2E testing as callable tools from agents  
**Capabilities**: Cross-browser testing, visual regression, performance metrics
**Setup**: `claude mcp add playwright --scope user -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest`

#### Linear/Jira - Vendor-Neutral Ticketing

**Purpose**: Connect preferred tracker through MCP servers
**Integration**: Status updates, requirement linking, artifact attachment
**Setup**: Various based on vendor (Linear, Atlassian, etc.)

### MCP Integration Patterns

- **Context7**: Auto-invoked by context-fetcher for vendor documentation
- **Playwright**: Used by playwright-tester for E2E test execution
- **Ticketing**: Updated throughout workflow for status and artifact tracking

## Standard Development Workflow (Leo's Process)

### From Ticket to Merge - Complete Flow

#### Step 1: Planning & Scope (`/plan`)

```
Input: Ticket ID + constraints + goal + context
Flow: AI Mesh Orchestrator → tech-lead-orchestrator + context-fetcher
Output: Clear TRD with acceptance criteria and task breakdown
```

#### Step 2: Create/Update Ticket

```
Flow: Update ticket via Ticketing MCP with TRD, criteria, and links
Validation: Status, assignee, labels, concrete testable ACs
```

#### Step 3: Implementation (`/build`)

```
Flow: git-workflow → implement incrementally → test-runner after each step
Strategy: Part A (API/schema) → Part B (service) → Part C (UI)
Output: Unit and integration tests passing, idiomatic code
```

#### Step 4: E2E Testing (`/test e2e`)

```
Flow: playwright-tester generates/updates specs, runs with traces
Validation: Covers acceptance criteria, stable selectors, auth helpers
Output: Green E2E suite with artifacts for debugging
```

#### Step 5: Quality Gate (`/review`)

```
Flow: code-reviewer enforces DoD (security, performance, maintainability)
Requirements: All high-severity findings addressed, tests still green
Output: Security validated, performance checked, patches applied
```

#### Step 6: Documentation & PR (`/document`)

```
Flow: git-workflow creates PR + documentation-specialist updates docs
Output: CHANGELOG, migration notes, clear PR with TRD summary
```

#### Step 7: Merge & Close

```
Flow: Ticketing MCP updates status, work-completion-summary for stakeholders
Result: Ticket closed, PR merged, documentation updated, tests green on CI
```

### Quality Gates (Definition of Done)

An item is **Done** only when ALL are true:

- [ ] **Scope**: TRD updated; acceptance criteria satisfied (unit/integration/E2E)
- [ ] **Code**: Reviewed by code-reviewer; no high-severity findings remain
- [ ] **Security**: Inputs validated; secrets/config safe; authZ/authN rules enforced
- [ ] **Performance**: Meets perf budget or accepted trade-off documented
- [ ] **Docs**: PR body clear; CHANGELOG/migration notes updated; runbooks adjusted
- [ ] **Ticket**: Status updated via MCP; links to PR, TRD, artifacts included

## Quick Start & Deployment

### Bootstrap from Scratch (Leo's Process)

**Prerequisites**: macOS/Linux, Node 18+, Git, Claude Code installed

#### 1. MCP Server Setup (Optional - enhances functionality)

```bash
# Install recommended MCP servers
claude mcp add context7 --scope user -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest
claude mcp add playwright --scope user -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest
claude mcp add linear --scope user -- npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.linear.app/sse

# Verify installation
claude mcp list
```

#### 2. Deploy Sub-Agent Mesh (Enhanced Installation System)

```bash
# Clone and navigate to repo
git clone https://github.com/FortiumPartners/claude-config.git && cd claude-config

# Run enhanced interactive installer
./install.sh

# Installation process:
# 1. Choose installation scope:
#    - Global (~/claude/) - Available across all projects (Recommended)
#    - Local (.claude/) - Project-specific configuration
# 2. Automatic backup of existing configuration with timestamp
# 3. Clean installation with move (not copy) for fresh setup
# 4. Install 17+ specialized agents with enhanced capabilities
# 5. Install commands (/plan-product, /analyze-product, etc.)
# 6. Comprehensive validation and verification
# 7. Professional UX with color-coded progress reporting
```

#### 3. Post-Installation Verification

```bash
# Installation automatically validates, but for manual verification:

# Global installation check:
ls ~/.claude/agents/ ~/.claude/commands/

# Local installation check:
ls .claude/agents/ .claude/commands/

# Restart Claude Code to load new configuration
# Test commands:
# /plan-product "describe your product idea"
# /analyze-product
# /execute-tasks
# /fold-prompt
```

### Usage Patterns
