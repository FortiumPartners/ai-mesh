## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: NPM Installation (Recommended) ✨ **NEW**

Professional Node.js installer with cross-platform support:

```bash
# Global installation (recommended)
npm install -g @fortium/claude-installer
claude-installer install --global

# Or use npx for one-time installation
npx @fortium/claude-installer install --global

# Local project installation
npx @fortium/claude-installer install --local
```

**NPM Installation Benefits:**
- ✅ **Cross-platform**: macOS, Linux, Windows support
- ✅ **Zero dependencies**: No bash, Python, or additional tools required
- ✅ **Professional CLI**: Interactive prompts with colored output
- ✅ **Automatic validation**: Comprehensive health checks
- ✅ **Error recovery**: Rollback capabilities and detailed logging
- ✅ **API access**: Programmatic interface for automation

#### Option 2: Legacy Installation (Compatibility)

For users who prefer the original bash script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FortiumPartners/claude-config.git
cd claude-config

# Run the interactive installer
./install.sh

# Follow the prompts:
# 1) Choose Global (1) or Local (2) installation
# 2) Automatic backup of existing configuration
# 3) Installation validation and verification
```

### Installation Modes

**Global Installation** (Recommended)
- Installs to `~/.claude/` (your home directory)
- Available to Claude Code across all projects
- Agents and commands work from any directory

**Local Installation** (Project-specific)
- Installs to `.claude/` (current project directory)
- Available only when working in this specific project
- Perfect for project-specific configurations

### 🔔 Important: Hook Installation Changes (v2.8.0)

**As of version 2.8.0, development hooks are NO LONGER installed by default.**

The hook framework (`hooks/` directory) has been removed from the standard installation process to provide a cleaner, more flexible setup. If you need the hook framework for activity tracking and metrics:

- **Hooks are available in the repository** but require manual setup
- **See `hooks/README.md`** for installation and configuration instructions
- **Activity tracking** can be enabled separately if needed for your workflow

This change improves installation speed and reduces complexity for users who don't require the hook framework.

### Post-Installation

```bash
# Restart Claude Code to load the new configuration

# Validate installation
claude-installer validate
# or: npx @fortium/claude-installer validate

# Explore available agents and commands
# Global: ls ~/.claude/agents/ ~/.claude/commands/
# Local: ls .claude/agents/ .claude/commands/

# Use the fold-prompt command for project analysis
# (Command details available in commands/fold-prompt.md)
```

### Programmatic Installation (CI/CD)

For automated deployments and CI/CD pipelines:

```javascript
const { createInstaller, quickInstall, quickValidate } = require('@fortium/claude-installer');

// Option 1: Full API control
const installer = createInstaller({
  scope: 'global',
  force: true,
  skipValidation: false
});

const result = await installer.install();
console.log('Installation success:', result.success);

// Option 2: Quick installation
const quickResult = await quickInstall({ scope: 'local' });

// Option 3: Quick validation
const isValid = await quickValidate();
console.log('Installation valid:', isValid.success);
```

### Advanced Features ✨ **NEW**

**CLI Management:**
```bash
# Update existing installation
claude-installer update

# Force reinstallation
claude-installer install --global --force

# Skip environment validation (faster)
claude-installer install --local --skip-validation

# Get detailed help
claude-installer install --help
```

**API Features:**
```javascript
// Check if already installed
const isInstalled = await installer.isInstalled('global');

// Get installation details
const validation = await installer.validate();
console.log(`Agents: ${validation.summary.agents}`);
console.log(`Commands: ${validation.summary.commands}`);
console.log(`Hooks: ${validation.summary.hooks}`);

// Error handling
try {
  await installer.install();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Installation failed:', error.message);
}
```
