## 🚀 Quick Start (Leo's Process)

### 1. Prerequisites
- macOS/Linux, Node 18+, Git, Docker
- Claude Code installed (desktop or CLI)

### 2. MCP Server Setup
```bash
# Install required MCP servers
claude mcp add context7 --scope user -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest
claude mcp add playwright --scope user -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest  
claude mcp add linear --scope user -- npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.linear.app/sse

# Verify installation
claude mcp list
```

### 3. Deploy Sub-Agent Mesh
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FortiumPartners/claude-config.git

# Deploy complete agent mesh
cd claude-config
bash scripts/seed_sub_agents.sh

# Verify agents created
ls .claude/agents/
```

### 4. Validate Setup
```bash
# In Claude Code, verify agents and MCP servers
/agents  # Should show full 13-agent mesh
# Test MCP integration
"Use Playwright MCP to open example.com and assert title contains 'Example'"
```

### 5. First Feature Development
```bash
# Complete Leo's workflow
/plan [ticket-link + constraints + goal]     # → TRD + task breakdown
# Update ticket via MCP with TRD and criteria
/build [incremental implementation]          # → code + passing tests
/test e2e [E2E coverage with traces]        # → Playwright validation
/review [DoD enforcement]                    # → security + performance
/document [PR creation + CHANGELOG]         # → merge-ready documentation
```

## 📦 Core Components

### 🤖 Sub-Agent Mesh (13 Agents)

**Purpose**: Complete AI-augmented development ecosystem with specialized domain expertise

**Core Orchestration**:
- **meta-agent**: Chief orchestrator; spawns and improves specialists on-demand
- **general-purpose**: Handles ambiguous scope; routes to specialists  
- **context-fetcher**: Pulls authoritative references (AgentOS, Context7)

**Development Specialists**:
- **tech-lead-orchestrator**: Product → technical planning with TRD generation
- **frontend-developer**: Framework-agnostic UI with accessibility and performance
- **backend-developer**: Server-side with clean architecture and reliability
- **code-reviewer**: Security/quality DoD enforcement before PR merge
- **test-runner**: Unit/integration test execution with failure triage
- **playwright-tester**: E2E testing with Playwright MCP integration

**Framework & Utility Specialists**:
- **react-component-architect**: React components with hooks and state management
- **rails-backend-expert**: Rails controllers, services, and background jobs
- **documentation-specialist**: PRD/TRD/API docs with structured templates
- **git-workflow**: Safe git operations with conventional commits
- **file-creator**: File/directory creation with project templates

### ⚡ Structured Command Workflows

**Purpose**: Leo's complete development lifecycle with AI-augmented intelligence

**Core Workflow Pattern**:
```bash
/plan [ticket-link + constraints + goal]     # → TRD + task breakdown
/build [incremental implementation]          # → code + passing tests  
/test e2e [E2E coverage with traces]        # → Playwright validation
/review [DoD enforcement]                    # → security + performance
/document [PR creation + CHANGELOG]         # → merge-ready documentation
```

**Command Categories**:
- **Planning**: `/plan` with tech-lead-orchestrator + context-fetcher integration
- **Implementation**: `/build` with framework detection and intelligent persona routing
- **Testing**: `/test e2e` with playwright-tester and trace capture
- **Quality**: `/review` with code-reviewer DoD enforcement
- **Documentation**: `/document` with documentation-specialist and structured templates

### 🔌 MCP Server Integration

**Purpose**: Model Context Protocol servers for enhanced AI capabilities

**Required MCP Servers**:
- **Context7**: Versioned documentation and framework patterns with version awareness
- **Playwright**: Browser automation, E2E testing, and cross-browser validation
- **Linear**: Vendor-neutral ticketing integration (alternative: Jira/Confluence MCP)

**Integration Benefits**:
- **Real-time Documentation**: Context7 injects library-specific patterns and examples
- **Automated Testing**: Playwright MCP enables browser automation from sub-agents
- **Ticket Coordination**: Update tickets directly with TRD and acceptance criteria
- **Quality Gates**: MCP-powered validation and compliance checking

## 🎯 Productivity Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Development Speed**: 30% reduction in routine task completion time
- **Error Reduction**: 50% decrease in configuration-related issues
- **Automation Coverage**: 80% of repetitive tasks automated
- **User Satisfaction**: 90+ NPS score from customer feedback

### Measurement Framework

- **Baseline Assessment**: Pre-implementation performance benchmarks
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous productivity tracking
- **Regular Reviews**: Monthly trend analysis and optimization
- **Customer Validation**: Quarterly satisfaction surveys

## 🔧 AgentOS Standards (Leo's Process)

### Structured Development Templates

All development follows AgentOS structured standards:

- **PRD**: Product Requirements with acceptance criteria and user personas
- **TRD**: Technical Requirements with architecture and testing strategy  
- **DoD**: Definition of Done with 8-category quality gates
- **AC**: Acceptance Criteria with Given-When-Then format

### Quality Gate Framework

Every feature undergoes comprehensive validation:

1. **Planning Gate**: PRD/TRD completion with stakeholder approval
2. **Implementation Gate**: Code quality and test coverage verification
3. **Testing Gate**: Unit, integration, and E2E validation with Playwright
4. **Security Gate**: Automated security scanning and threat assessment
5. **Performance Gate**: Load testing and optimization validation
6. **Documentation Gate**: Complete documentation with examples
7. **Review Gate**: Code-reviewer agent DoD enforcement
8. **Deployment Gate**: Production readiness verification
