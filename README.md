## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Claude Code Users

#### Installation Options

The installer provides two installation modes to suit different use cases:

**Option 1: Global Installation (Recommended for most users)**
- Installs to `~/.claude/` (your home directory)
- Available to Claude Code across all projects
- Agents and commands work from any directory

**Option 2: Local Installation (Project-specific)**
- Installs to `.claude/` (current project directory)
- Available only when working in this specific project
- Perfect for project-specific configurations

#### Installation Process

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FortiumPartners/claude-config.git
cd claude-config

# Run the interactive installer
./install.sh

# Follow the prompts:
# 1) Choose Global (1) or Local (2) installation
# 2) Automatic backup of existing configuration
# 3) Installation validation and verification
```

#### Post-Installation

```bash
# Restart Claude Code to load the new configuration

# Explore available agents and commands
# Global: ls ~/.claude/agents/ ~/.claude/commands/
# Local: ls .claude/agents/ .claude/commands/

# Use the fold-prompt command for project analysis
# (Command details available in commands/fold-prompt.md)
```

#### Legacy Installation (Deprecated)

For existing users with the old installation method:

```bash
~/partner-os/claude_install.sh
```

### Using This Configuration

#### Product Workflow Commands

##### For a new 'greenfield' project

```claude
/plan-product "prompt describing what your product does"
```

##### For an existing 'brownfield' project

```claude
/analyze-product
```

##### Execute planned tasks

```claude
/execute-tasks
```

##### Optimize project documentation

```claude
/fold-prompt
```

#### Additional Capabilities

- **17+ Specialized Agents**: Enhanced meta-agent orchestration with intelligent delegation
- **Enhanced Installation**: Global or local installation with automated backup
- **MCP Integration**: Context7, Playwright, Linear server support
- **AgentOS Standards**: Product management with structured workflows

### For Developers

```bash
# Fork the repository
# Create feature branch: feature/your-enhancement
# Follow contribution guidelines in CLAUDE.md
# Submit PR with productivity impact metrics
```

## 📦 Core Components

### 🤖 AI Agents

**Purpose**: Specialized AI assistants for domain-specific development tasks

**Current Agent Mesh (17+ Specialized Agents)**:

**Core Orchestration**:
- `meta-agent`: Chief orchestrator with enhanced delegation and conflict resolution
- `general-purpose`: Complex research and multi-domain task handling
- `context-fetcher`: Reference gathering and AgentOS integration

**Development Specialists**:
- `tech-lead-orchestrator`: Product → technical planning with risk assessment
- `frontend-developer`: Framework-agnostic UI with accessibility focus
- `backend-developer`: Clean architecture server-side development
- `react-component-architect`: React components with modern hooks patterns
- `rails-backend-expert`: Rails MVC, ActiveRecord, background jobs

**Quality & Testing**:
- `code-reviewer`: Enhanced security scanning and DoD enforcement
- `test-runner`: Unit/integration test execution with intelligent failure triage
- `playwright-tester`: E2E testing with Playwright MCP integration

**Workflow Management**:
- `git-workflow`: Enhanced git operations with conventional commits and best practices
- `documentation-specialist`: PRD/TRD/API documentation with examples
- `file-creator`: Template-based scaffolding with project conventions
- `directory-monitor`: Automated change detection and workflow triggering

### ⚡ Command Library

**Purpose**: Pre-built, optimized workflows for common development tasks
