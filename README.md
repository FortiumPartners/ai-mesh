## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Claude Code Users

#### Installation Options

The installer provides two installation modes to suit different use cases:

**Option 1: Global Installation (Recommended for most users)**
- Installs to `~/.claude/` (your home directory)
- Available to Claude Code across all projects
- Agents and commands work from any directory

**Option 2: Local Installation (Project-specific)**
- Installs to `.claude/` (current project directory)
- Available only when working in this specific project
- Perfect for project-specific configurations

#### Installation Process

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FortiumPartners/claude-config.git
cd claude-config

# Run the interactive installer
./install.sh

# Follow the prompts:
# 1) Choose Global (1) or Local (2) installation
# 2) Automatic backup of existing configuration
# 3) Installation validation and verification
```

#### Post-Installation

```bash
# Restart Claude Code to load the new configuration

# Explore available agents and commands
# Global: ls ~/.claude/agents/ ~/.claude/commands/
# Local: ls .claude/agents/ .claude/commands/

# Use the fold-prompt command for project analysis
# (Command details available in commands/fold-prompt.md)
```
