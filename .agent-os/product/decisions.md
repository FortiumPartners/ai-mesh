## 2025-08-27: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Fortium Partners

### Decision

Fortium Claude Configuration will be a comprehensive toolkit for AI-augmented development workflows, targeting Fortium Partners initially and expanding to all Fortium clients. Core features include specialized sub-agents, AgentOS integration, and proven productivity improvements of 30%.

### Context

Fortium Partners need standardized, battle-tested Claude Code configurations that deliver measurable productivity improvements. The market opportunity exists for AI-augmented development workflows that go beyond basic Claude setups to provide comprehensive agent ecosystems and structured development processes.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic Claude Configuration Repository**
   - Pros: Simpler to maintain, broader appeal, lower complexity
   - Cons: No differentiation, limited value proposition, no proven framework

2. **Custom Internal Tool Development**
   - Pros: Complete control, proprietary advantage, custom features
   - Cons: High development cost, longer time to market, maintenance burden

3. **Partner with Existing AI Development Platform**
   - Pros: Faster to market, proven platform, reduced development
   - Cons: Less control, dependency risk, limited customization

### Rationale

Key factors in decision:
- Agent-OS provides proven framework foundation with structured workflows
- Fortium Partners represent high-value target market with clear needs
- Sub-agent mesh architecture offers significant competitive differentiation
- Measurable 30% productivity improvements provide clear value proposition
- Building on agent-os reduces development risk and time to market

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear value proposition with measurable productivity improvements
- Competitive differentiation through comprehensive sub-agent ecosystem
- Built on proven agent-os framework reduces technical risk
- Strong target market with Fortium Partners and expansion potential
- Structured development workflows improve team standardization

**Negative:**
- Dependency on agent-os framework for core functionality
- Limited to Fortium ecosystem initially (though planned for expansion)
- Complexity of maintaining 15+ specialized sub-agents
- Need for ongoing MCP server integration maintenance
- Higher learning curve compared to simple configurations

## 2025-08-27: Technical Architecture Decisions

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use agent-os v4.0 as the core framework with MCP server integration (Context7, Playwright, Linear) and specialized sub-agent mesh architecture for comprehensive development workflow automation.

### Context

Need to choose technical architecture that provides proven stability, comprehensive functionality, and extensibility for future enhancements while maintaining compatibility with Claude Code and SuperClaude framework.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Custom Framework Development**
   - Pros: Complete control, optimized for specific use case
   - Cons: High development cost, longer development time, unproven stability

2. **Basic Claude Code Configuration**
   - Pros: Simple, direct integration, minimal dependencies
   - Cons: Limited functionality, no structured workflows, manual processes

### Rationale

- Agent-OS provides battle-tested framework with structured documentation standards
- MCP server integration offers comprehensive tooling ecosystem
- Sub-agent mesh enables specialized functionality for different roles
- Proven track record with measurable productivity improvements

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Leverages proven framework reducing development risk
- Comprehensive tooling through MCP server integration
- Specialized agents provide targeted functionality
- Structured workflows improve team consistency

**Negative:**
- Dependency on external framework and MCP servers
- Complexity in maintaining multiple integration points
- Learning curve for teams adopting the full ecosystem
