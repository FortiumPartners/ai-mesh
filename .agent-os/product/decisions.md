## 2025-08-27: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Fortium Partners

### Decision

Fortium Claude Configuration will be a comprehensive toolkit for AI-augmented development workflows, targeting Fortium Partners initially and expanding to all Fortium clients. Core features include specialized sub-agents, AgentOS integration, and proven productivity improvements of 30%.

### Context

Fortium Partners need standardized, battle-tested Claude Code configurations that deliver measurable productivity improvements. The market opportunity exists for AI-augmented development workflows that go beyond basic Claude setups to provide comprehensive agent ecosystems and structured development processes.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic Claude Configuration Repository**
   - Pros: Simpler to maintain, broader appeal, lower complexity
   - Cons: No differentiation, limited value proposition, no proven framework

2. **Custom Internal Tool Development**
   - Pros: Complete control, proprietary advantage, custom features
   - Cons: High development cost, longer time to market, maintenance burden

3. **Partner with Existing AI Development Platform**
   - Pros: Faster to market, proven platform, reduced development
   - Cons: Less control, dependency risk, limited customization

### Rationale

Key factors in decision:
- Agent-OS provides proven framework foundation with structured workflows
- Fortium Partners represent high-value target market with clear needs
- Sub-agent mesh architecture offers significant competitive differentiation
- Measurable 30% productivity improvements provide clear value proposition
- Building on agent-os reduces development risk and time to market

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear value proposition with measurable productivity improvements
- Competitive differentiation through comprehensive sub-agent ecosystem
- Built on proven agent-os framework reduces technical risk
- Strong target market with Fortium Partners and expansion potential
- Structured development workflows improve team standardization

**Negative:**
- Dependency on agent-os framework for core functionality
- Limited to Fortium ecosystem initially (though planned for expansion)
- Complexity of maintaining 15+ specialized sub-agents
- Need for ongoing MCP server integration maintenance
- Higher learning curve compared to simple configurations

## 2025-08-27: Technical Architecture Decisions

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use agent-os v4.0 as the core framework with MCP server integration (Context7, Playwright, Linear) and specialized sub-agent mesh architecture for comprehensive development workflow automation.

### Context

Need to choose technical architecture that provides proven stability, comprehensive functionality, and extensibility for future enhancements while maintaining compatibility with Claude Code and SuperClaude framework.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Custom Framework Development**
   - Pros: Complete control, optimized for specific use case
   - Cons: High development cost, longer development time, unproven stability

2. **Basic Claude Code Configuration**
   - Pros: Simple, direct integration, minimal dependencies
   - Cons: Limited functionality, no structured workflows, manual processes

### Rationale

- Agent-OS provides battle-tested framework with structured documentation standards
- MCP server integration offers comprehensive tooling ecosystem
- Sub-agent mesh enables specialized functionality for different roles
- Proven track record with measurable productivity improvements

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Leverages proven framework reducing development risk
- Comprehensive tooling through MCP server integration
- Specialized agents provide targeted functionality
- Structured workflows improve team consistency

**Negative:**
- Dependency on external framework and MCP servers
- Complexity in maintaining multiple integration points
- Learning curve for teams adopting the full ecosystem

## 2025-09-03: External Metrics Web Service Architecture

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical - Data Strategy
**Related Spec:** @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-03-external-metrics-service-#8/

### Decision

Implement external metrics web service for productivity analytics and team performance tracking, transitioning from local-only metrics collection to a centralized, multi-tenant SaaS platform with real-time dashboards and enterprise features.

### Context

Current productivity tracking is limited to local command usage within individual Claude configurations. To deliver on the 30% productivity increase promise and support enterprise features (Phase 2-3 roadmap), we need comprehensive metrics collection, cross-team analytics, and real-time dashboard capabilities that exceed local file-based limitations.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Enhanced Local Metrics Collection**
   - Pros: Maintains privacy, simpler architecture, no external dependencies
   - Cons: No cross-team analytics, limited enterprise features, manual aggregation

2. **Integration with Existing Analytics Platforms**
   - Pros: Leverages existing tools, faster implementation
   - Cons: Limited customization, potential data privacy issues, dependency on third-party platforms

3. **File-based Central Reporting System**
   - Pros: Familiar architecture, lower complexity
   - Cons: Poor real-time capabilities, manual synchronization, limited scalability

### Rationale

Key factors in decision:
- Enables validation of core value proposition (30% productivity increase) across teams and organizations
- Supports Engineering Manager persona's need for "real-time team visibility" and "productivity bottleneck identification"
- Required for enterprise features in roadmap (multi-team support, advanced analytics, executive reporting)
- Provides significant competitive differentiation through comprehensive productivity insights
- Allows measurement and optimization of the complete AI-augmented development workflow

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Enables enterprise-scale productivity measurement and validation
- Provides real-time visibility for managers and executives
- Supports competitive differentiation through advanced analytics capabilities
- Enables data-driven optimization of AI-augmented development workflows
- Creates foundation for predictive analytics and automated recommendations

**Negative:**
- Introduces external data collection with associated privacy and security responsibilities
- Increases architectural complexity with web service components
- Requires additional infrastructure, monitoring, and operational expertise
- Creates dependency on external service for complete feature functionality
- Potential resistance from privacy-conscious organizations regarding development metrics
