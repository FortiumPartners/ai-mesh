# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: External Metrics Web Service  
> Created: 2025-09-03  
> GitHub Issue: #8  
> Status: Planning  

## Overview

Create an external web service to replace the current local metrics collection system with an enterprise-ready, multi-tenant SaaS platform. This service will provide real-time productivity analytics, team performance dashboards, and comprehensive metrics visualization for Fortium Partners and their development teams. The current system relies on local metrics collection within individual Claude configurations. This spec defines the migration to a centralized, scalable web service that maintains all existing functionality while adding enterprise features like multi-tenancy, real-time collaboration, advanced analytics, and centralized administration.

## User Stories

### Engineering Manager Dashboard Access

As an Engineering Manager, I want real-time visibility into my team's productivity metrics across all projects, so that I can identify bottlenecks, optimize workflows, and demonstrate ROI from AI-augmented development tools.

The manager needs a comprehensive dashboard showing team velocity, agent usage patterns, error rates, and productivity improvements. They should be able to filter by team member, project, or time period, receive automated alerts for productivity anomalies, and export reports for stakeholder presentations. The dashboard must update in real-time to provide immediate insights into team performance.

### Product Manager Analytics Access

As a Product Manager, I want cross-team analytics and historical trends for development velocity, so that I can make data-driven decisions about resource allocation and process improvements.

The PM requires comparative analytics across multiple development teams, historical trend analysis to identify seasonal patterns, correlation between productivity metrics and product delivery milestones, and predictive analytics for sprint planning and capacity management. The system should provide executive-level dashboards with high-level KPIs and drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis.

### Developer Personal Insights

As a Developer using Claude Code with Fortium configurations, I want personal productivity insights and progress tracking, so that I can understand my own efficiency patterns and improve my development workflows.

Developers need personal dashboards showing their agent usage patterns, productivity metrics compared to team averages (anonymized), personalized recommendations for workflow optimization, and goal-setting capabilities with achievement tracking. The interface should be intuitive and motivating, encouraging continuous improvement without being punitive.

### System Administrator Enterprise Management

As a System Administrator, I want centralized management of metrics collection and user access, so that I can deploy enterprise-wide productivity tracking with proper security and compliance.

Administrators require user management with role-based access control, organizational settings and data retention policy configuration, system health monitoring and performance tracking of the metrics service, and integration with existing enterprise authentication systems (SSO). The admin interface should provide comprehensive control over tenant configuration and service operations.

## Spec Scope

1. **Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture** - Complete tenant isolation with scalable infrastructure supporting multiple organizations and their teams
2. **Real-Time Dashboard System** - Interactive web-based dashboards with live updates, customizable widgets, and role-specific views
3. **MCP Server Integration** - Seamless integration maintaining backward compatibility with existing MCP protocol and agent ecosystem
4. **Enterprise Authentication** - SSO integration with RBAC, audit logging, and compliance-ready user management
5. **Data Migration Tools** - Automated migration utilities preserving historical productivity baselines and trend data

## Out of Scope

- Mobile native applications (iOS/Android apps) - responsive web interface only
- On-premise deployment options - cloud-first architecture with no self-hosting support
- Custom metrics beyond productivity tracking - focus on AI-augmented development metrics only
- Advanced AI/ML recommendations - descriptive analytics and real-time monitoring focus

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Multi-Tenant Web Service** - Deployed SaaS application with sub-second response times, 99.9% uptime, and enterprise scalability
2. **Real-Time Browser Dashboards** - Modern responsive interface with live updates, customizable layouts, and export capabilities
3. **MCP Integration Success** - Zero-disruption migration with full backward compatibility and <5ms performance overhead
