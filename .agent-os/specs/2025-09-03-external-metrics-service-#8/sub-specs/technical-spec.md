# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-03-external-metrics-service-#8/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-03
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Cloud-native microservices architecture** supporting horizontal scaling and fault isolation
- **Real-time data ingestion** capable of handling 10,000+ concurrent metric streams with sub-second processing
- **Multi-tenant data isolation** using PostgreSQL row-level security and tenant-specific data partitioning
- **Sub-second dashboard queries** with efficient time-series data retrieval and caching strategies
- **MCP server protocol compatibility** maintaining full backward compatibility with existing agent ecosystem
- **Enterprise-grade security** including data encryption, API rate limiting, and audit logging
- **High availability** with 99.9% uptime SLA and automated failover capabilities

## Approach Options

**Option A: Monolithic Architecture**
- Pros: Simpler deployment, easier development initially, single codebase
- Cons: Difficult to scale individual components, single point of failure, technology lock-in

**Option B: Microservices with API Gateway (Selected)**
- Pros: Independent scaling, fault isolation, technology diversity, team autonomy
- Cons: Increased complexity, service orchestration challenges, network latency

**Option C: Serverless Functions**
- Pros: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use, no infrastructure management
- Cons: Cold start latency, vendor lock-in, complex state management

**Rationale:** Selected microservices approach because metrics collection and dashboard rendering have different performance characteristics. Collection requires high throughput and low latency, while dashboards need complex querying and visualization. Independent scaling allows optimizing each service separately while maintaining fault isolation.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Dashboard Application
- **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and modern development patterns
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit for predictable state management and time-travel debugging
- **Real-time Updates:** Socket.io client for live dashboard updates and collaborative features
- **Charting:** Chart.js or D3.js for interactive productivity visualizations and custom metrics displays
- **Authentication:** OAuth2/OIDC integration with JWT token management and automatic refresh

### Backend API Services
- **Runtime:** Node.js 18+ with Express framework for consistency with MCP ecosystem
- **Language:** TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **API Gateway:** Kong or AWS API Gateway for request routing, rate limiting, and authentication
- **Metrics Collection Service:** High-throughput service for ingesting productivity data from MCP clients
- **Dashboard API Service:** Optimized for complex queries and data aggregation for dashboard rendering
- **User Management Service:** Handles authentication, authorization, and tenant management

### Database Layer
- **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL 15+ with time-series optimizations and partitioning for metrics storage
- **Caching Layer:** Redis 7+ for session management, query result caching, and real-time data buffering
- **Search Engine:** Elasticsearch for full-text search across metrics metadata and advanced analytics
- **Backup Strategy:** Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery and cross-region replication

### Message Queue and Processing
- **Message Broker:** Apache Kafka for reliable metrics streaming and event-driven architecture
- **Stream Processing:** Apache Kafka Streams for real-time metrics aggregation and anomaly detection
- **Background Jobs:** Bull Queue with Redis for handling data migration, report generation, and cleanup tasks

### Deployment and Infrastructure
- **Containerization:** Docker containers with multi-stage builds for optimal image size and security
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for auto-scaling, service discovery, and rolling deployments
- **Cloud Platform:** AWS or Google Cloud Platform with managed services for reduced operational overhead
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana for system metrics, with custom dashboards for service health
- **Logging:** Centralized logging with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for debugging and audit trails
