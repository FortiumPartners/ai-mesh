## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**AI Mesh Orchestrator**
- Test agent selection logic based on task type and complexity
- Test delegation decision-making algorithms with fallback mechanisms
- Test role-based task routing and agent availability checking
- Test performance optimization and intelligent agent matching

**Tech Lead Orchestrator**
- Test product-to-technical planning functionality and PRD to TRD conversion
- Test architecture decision documentation and risk assessment
- Test stakeholder communication formatting and technical requirement analysis

**Command Routing**
- Test command parsing and interpretation accuracy
- Test orchestrator selection logic and parameter validation
- Test error handling for invalid commands and performance benchmarks

### Integration Tests

**Agent Mesh Coordination**
- Test cross-agent communication protocols and shared context management
- Test sequential task execution chains and parallel task coordination
- Test conflict resolution mechanisms and multi-agent workflow validation

**Command Workflows**
- Test complete workflow validation from `/plan-product` through `/execute-tasks`
- Test inter-command dependencies and state management across commands
- Test error propagation and recovery with performance monitoring

**MCP Integration**
- Test Context7 documentation retrieval and Playwright automation execution
- Test Linear ticketing integration and server availability handling
- Test authentication and authorization with graceful degradation

### Mocking Requirements

- **External Services**: Mock Context7, Playwright, and Linear MCP servers with various response scenarios
- **Agent Responses**: Mock success/failure scenarios, performance variations, and different context situations
- **File System Operations**: Mock file operations for safe testing of renaming and structure changes
