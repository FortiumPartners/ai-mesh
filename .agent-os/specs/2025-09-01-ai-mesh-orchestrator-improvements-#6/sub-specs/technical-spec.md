# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-01-ai-mesh-orchestrator-improvements-#6/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-01
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **File Structure Changes**: Rename `.claude/agents/orcastrator.md` to `ai-mesh-orchestrator.md` with updated internal structure for role clarity
- **Command Routing Implementation**: Intelligent command routing based on command patterns and context with sub-100ms routing decision time
- **Agent Delegation Framework**: Smart agent selection based on task requirements, agent capabilities, availability, and performance history
- **Integration Compatibility**: Maintain full backward compatibility with existing agent mesh and preserve current command functionality
- **Performance Requirements**: Command routing latency <100ms, agent selection accuracy >95%, zero breaking changes to existing functionality

## Approach Options

**Option A: Monolithic Orchestrator Enhancement (Selected)**
- Pros: Minimal disruption to existing architecture, maintains simplicity while improving organization, easier to maintain and debug
- Cons: Single file may become large but remains manageable with clear internal structure

**Option B: Multi-File Orchestrator Architecture**
- Pros: Maximum separation of concerns and modularity
- Cons: Adds complexity to agent mesh architecture, requires changes to Claude Code agent discovery, over-engineering for current requirements

**Rationale:** Option A selected for minimal disruption while maximizing benefit through enhanced internal organization and clear role separation.

## External Dependencies

- **Claude Code Integration** - Compatible with current Claude Code releases for agent discovery and execution
- **MCP Server Ecosystem** - Context7, Playwright, and Linear integration with graceful degradation if unavailable
- **Agent-OS Framework** - Maintain compliance with Agent-OS v4.0+ standards and conventions
- **Existing Agent Mesh** - Full compatibility with all 17+ existing specialized agents through comprehensive integration testing
