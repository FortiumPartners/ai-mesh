> Status: Planning

## Overview

Refactor and improve the agent mesh orchestration system by clarifying roles between tech-lead-orchestrator and the main orchestrator, renaming orchestrator.md to ai-mesh-orchestrator.md for better role clarity, and enhancing agent coordination workflows.

## User Stories

### Clear Orchestrator Role Separation

As a developer using the Claude configuration system, I want clear separation between product planning (tech-lead-orchestrator) and agent mesh coordination (ai-mesh-orchestrator) so that I get the right type of assistance without role confusion and overlapping responsibilities.

The user runs `/plan-product` → tech-lead-orchestrator handles product analysis and PRD creation, while `/execute-tasks` → ai-mesh-orchestrator manages agent delegation and task coordination.

### Improved Agent Mesh Coordination

As a user executing complex development tasks, I want intelligent agent delegation that considers task complexity, agent specialization, and workflow dependencies so that tasks are completed efficiently with appropriate quality gates and handoffs between specialized agents.

User provides task → ai-mesh-orchestrator analyzes requirements → selects appropriate agents → coordinates handoffs → ensures quality validation → provides consolidated results.

### Enhanced Command Integration

As a developer using the command system, I want updated commands that properly route to the correct orchestrator based on task type so that product planning flows through tech-lead-orchestrator and execution flows through ai-mesh-orchestrator with consistent results.

Commands automatically route to appropriate orchestrator based on task classification, with clear documentation of which orchestrator handles each command type.

## Spec Scope

1. **Rename and Refactor Orchestrator File** - Rename `.claude/agents/orcastrator.md` to `ai-mesh-orchestrator.md` and update file content to focus specifically on agent mesh coordination and task delegation.

2. **Role Clarification Documentation** - Update ai-mesh-orchestrator.md to clearly define its role as the chief agent coordinator for task execution while ensuring tech-lead-orchestrator.md maintains focus on product → technical planning workflows.

3. **Command Routing Updates** - Update all command files to route to appropriate orchestrator based on task type, with product planning commands going to tech-lead-orchestrator and execution commands to ai-mesh-orchestrator.

4. **Agent Mesh Coordination Enhancement** - Improve intelligent agent selection algorithms, add workflow dependency tracking, implement quality gate enforcement between agent handoffs, and add performance monitoring.

5. **Documentation and Integration Updates** - Update README.md in agents directory, update CLAUDE.md references, and ensure all agent files correctly reference the new orchestrator structure.

## Out of Scope

- Product Requirements Creation - Remains with tech-lead-orchestrator, not part of ai-mesh-orchestrator responsibilities
- New Agent Creation - Focus is on improving coordination of existing agents, not creating new specialized agents
- MCP Server Integration Changes - Current MCP server setup remains unchanged
- Command System Architecture Changes - No changes to underlying command system structure, only routing updates

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Renamed and Enhanced ai-mesh-orchestrator.md** - Clear role definition focused on agent mesh coordination with improved delegation logic and quality gate enforcement.

2. **Updated Command Routing** - All commands properly route to appropriate orchestrator with clear documentation of routing logic and no ambiguity about which orchestrator handles each task type.

3. **Validated Workflow Integration** - Complete workflow testing showing smooth handoffs between tech-lead-orchestrator (planning) and ai-mesh-orchestrator (execution) with measurable improvements in task completion efficiency.
