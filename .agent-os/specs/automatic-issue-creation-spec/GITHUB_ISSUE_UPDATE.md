## ðŸ”§ Usage Example

```python
from project_management_integration import (
    create_project_management_integration,
    ProjectManagementConfig,
    NotificationContext
)

# Create PM integration
pm_integration = create_project_management_integration(
    github_config=github_config,
    pm_config=ProjectManagementConfig()
)

# Create issues with full PM features
context = ProjectManagementContext(
    repository_owner="FortiumPartners",
    repository_name="claude-config",
    spec_title="Automatic Issue Creation"
)

created_issues = await pm_integration.create_issues_with_project_management(
    hierarchy, context
)
```
