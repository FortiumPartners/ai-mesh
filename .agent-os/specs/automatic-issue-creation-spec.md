# Specification: Automatic Issue Creation for /create-spec Command

> Last Updated: 2025-08-30  
> Version: 1.0.0  
> Status: Draft  
> Author: AI-Augmented Development Team  

## Executive Summary

This specification defines an enhancement to the `/create-spec` command that automatically creates issues in linked ticketing systems (Linear, GitHub Issues) when specifications are generated. This ensures seamless integration between product planning and issue tracking, eliminating manual ticket creation overhead and maintaining perfect traceability between specifications and development work.

## Problem Statement

### Current Workflow Gaps

1. **Manual Issue Creation**: After creating specifications, teams must manually create corresponding issues in ticketing systems
2. **Inconsistent Linking**: Specifications and issues often lack proper cross-references
3. **Workflow Interruption**: Context switching between spec creation and issue management breaks flow
4. **Missing Traceability**: Poor mapping between spec sections and tracking tickets
5. **Duplicate Effort**: Information is entered twice (spec + issue) with potential inconsistencies

### Impact

- **Time Loss**: 5-10 minutes per spec on manual issue creation
- **Context Switching**: Breaks AI-augmented development flow
- **Tracking Gaps**: Missing or incomplete issue-to-spec mapping
- **Team Coordination**: Delayed handoff from product to development teams

## Proposed Solution

### Automatic Issue Creation System

Enhance the `/create-spec` command to automatically:

1. **Parse Specification Structure**: Extract epics, user stories, and tasks from generated specs
2. **Create Issue Hierarchy**: Generate parent-child issue relationships mirroring spec structure  
3. **Populate Issue Details**: Auto-fill titles, descriptions, labels, and acceptance criteria
4. **Link Bidirectionally**: Embed issue references in specs and spec references in issues
5. **Respect Team Configuration**: Use team-specific templates, assignees, and project settings

### Key Features

- **Vendor-Neutral Integration**: Support Linear MCP and GitHub Issues with extensible architecture
- **Smart Issue Detection**: Parse spec markdown to identify trackable work items
- **Hierarchical Mapping**: Epic → Parent Issue, User Stories → Child Issues, Tasks → Subtasks
- **Template System**: Configurable issue templates based on work type and team preferences
- **Bidirectional Linking**: Automatic cross-references between specs and issues

```

### Integration Points

#### Current /create-spec Workflow Enhancement
The system will insert **Phase 2.5: Automatic Issue Creation** between Steps 11 and 12:

**Step 11**: Write comprehensive specification (existing)  
**Step 11.5**: **Parse specification for issue creation** (NEW)  
**Step 11.6**: **Create issues in configured ticketing system** (NEW)  
**Step 11.7**: **Update specification with issue references** (NEW)  
**Step 12**: Create detailed task breakdown (existing, now enhanced with issue links)

#### MCP Server Integration
```yaml
supported_ticketing_systems:
  linear:
    mcp_server: "linear"
    capabilities: [create_issue, update_issue, search_issues, add_comment]
    issue_types: [feature, bug, improvement, epic]
    
  github:
    mcp_server: "github" 
    capabilities: [create_issue, update_issue, list_issues, add_issue_comment]
    issue_types: [feature, bug, enhancement, epic]
```

### Issue Detection Algorithm

```python
def parse_specification_for_issues(spec_content: str) -> List[IssueSpec]:
    """
    Parse specification markdown to extract trackable work items.
    
    Returns: List of issues with hierarchy and metadata
    """
    issues = []
    current_epic = None
    
    # Parse specification sections
    sections = parse_markdown_sections(spec_content)
    
    for section in sections:
        # Detect epics (## level headers with "Epic" or high-level features)
        if section.level == 2 and is_epic_section(section):
            current_epic = IssueSpec(
                type='epic',
                title=extract_title(section.content),
                description=extract_description(section.content),
                acceptance_criteria=extract_acceptance_criteria(section.content),
                parent=None
            )
            issues.append(current_epic)
        
        # Detect user stories (### level headers with "User Story" or features)
        elif section.level == 3 and is_user_story(section):
            story = IssueSpec(
                type='feature',
                title=extract_title(section.content),
                description=extract_description(section.content),
                acceptance_criteria=extract_acceptance_criteria(section.content),
                parent=current_epic
            )
            issues.append(story)
        
        # Detect tasks (#### level or checklist items)
        elif section.level == 4 or has_task_checklist(section):
            tasks = extract_tasks(section.content)
            for task in tasks:
                task_issue = IssueSpec(
                    type='task',
                    title=task.title,
                    description=task.description,
                    acceptance_criteria=task.acceptance_criteria,
                    parent=current_epic or get_current_story()
                )
                issues.append(task_issue)
    
    return issues
```
