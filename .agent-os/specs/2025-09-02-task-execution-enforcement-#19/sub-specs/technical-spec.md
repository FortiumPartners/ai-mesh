# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-02-task-execution-enforcement-#19/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-02
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### File System Monitoring
- Real-time detection of file modifications (create, edit, delete operations)
- Integration with Claude Code's file operation hooks
- Filtering to detect task-related activities (code files, configuration files, documentation)
- Performance-optimized monitoring with debouncing to prevent false positives

### Progressive Enforcement Engine
- **Level 1 (Reminder)**: Gentle notification with educational content about proper workflow
- **Level 2 (Warning)**: Prominent warning with guidance to use /execute-tasks command
- **Level 3 (Blocking)**: Prevention of direct file modifications with override authentication
- Escalation tracking per user session with configurable thresholds

### Claude Code Integration
- Hook into Claude Code command detection system
- Automatic detection of when /execute-tasks should be suggested
- Integration with existing agent routing and orchestration systems
- Compatibility with current MCP server ecosystem

### Override Authentication System
- Secure override mechanism for legitimate edge cases
- Audit trail for all override usage with timestamp and justification
- Admin-configurable override permissions and approval workflows
- Emergency bypass capabilities for critical situations

### Analytics and Reporting
- Real-time compliance rate tracking
- Productivity impact measurement (before/after workflow adoption)
- Violation pattern analysis and user behavior insights
- Integration with manager dashboard for team-level reporting

## Approach Options

**Option A: Client-Side File Monitoring**
- Pros: Direct file system integration, immediate detection, no server dependencies
- Cons: Platform-specific implementation, potential performance impact, limited cross-session tracking

**Option B: Claude Code Plugin Architecture**
- Pros: Native integration, consistent with existing architecture, centralized configuration
- Cons: Requires Claude Code modifications, dependency on Claude updates, limited extensibility

**Option C: Hybrid Monitoring with Claude Integration** (Selected)
- Pros: Combines file monitoring with command detection, flexible enforcement, comprehensive analytics
- Cons: Higher complexity, multiple integration points, requires careful synchronization

**Rationale:** Option C provides the most comprehensive solution by combining real-time file monitoring with deep Claude Code integration. This approach allows for intelligent detection of both direct file modifications and command usage patterns, enabling more accurate enforcement decisions and better user guidance.

## External Dependencies

**chokidar v3.5.3** - Cross-platform file system monitoring
- **Purpose:** Real-time file system event detection with high performance
- **Justification:** Battle-tested library with excellent cross-platform support and debouncing capabilities essential for reliable file monitoring

**sqlite3 v5.1.6** - Local database for analytics storage
- **Purpose:** Store compliance metrics, violation patterns, and productivity analytics
- **Justification:** Lightweight, serverless database perfect for local analytics storage with excellent Node.js integration and privacy compliance

**inquirer v9.2.7** - Interactive command-line prompts
- **Purpose:** User-friendly enforcement dialogs and override authentication
- **Justification:** Industry-standard library for CLI interactions with rich prompt types and excellent user experience

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

**File Monitor Service**
```
FileMonitor
├── EventDetector (chokidar integration)
├── PatternMatcher (task-related file detection)
├── EnforcementTrigger (violation detection)
└── AnalyticsCollector (metrics collection)
```

**Claude Integration Layer**
```
ClaudeIntegration
├── CommandHooks (command detection)
├── AgentRouter (sub-agent delegation)
├── SessionManager (user state tracking)
└── ConfigManager (enforcement settings)
```

**Enforcement Engine**
```
EnforcementEngine
├── ViolationTracker (escalation logic)
├── OverrideValidator (authentication)
├── NotificationSystem (user guidance)
└── ComplianceReporter (analytics)
```

### Data Flow

1. **File Modification Detected** → FileMonitor identifies task-related file change
2. **Violation Assessment** → Check if modification should use sub-agent delegation
3. **Enforcement Decision** → Determine appropriate enforcement level based on user history
4. **User Interaction** → Present enforcement UI (reminder/warning/blocking)
5. **Analytics Collection** → Record event data for compliance and productivity tracking
6. **Resolution** → Guide user to proper workflow or process override if approved

### Security Considerations

- Override authentication using secure token validation
- Audit logging with tamper-evident storage
- User privacy protection in analytics collection
- Secure configuration storage and access control

### Performance Requirements

- File monitoring latency: <100ms for detection
- Enforcement decision time: <50ms for real-time response
- Analytics processing: Background processing to avoid UI blocking
- Memory footprint: <50MB additional overhead
