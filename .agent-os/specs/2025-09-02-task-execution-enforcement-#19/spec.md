# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Task Execution Workflow Enforcement
> Created: 2025-09-02
> GitHub Issue: #19
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement automated enforcement of the task execution workflow to prevent direct file modifications in the main Claude session and ensure all code changes are delegated to specialized sub-agents. This system will provide progressive enforcement (reminders → warnings → blocking) with comprehensive analytics to maintain development workflow integrity and maximize productivity through proper agent orchestration.

## User Stories

### Workflow Enforcement for Developers

As a Software Developer, I want the system to automatically detect when I'm about to modify files directly in the main Claude session, so that I'm reminded to use the proper sub-agent delegation workflow and maintain code quality standards.

When I attempt to edit a file directly, the system should provide clear guidance on which sub-agent to use (/execute-tasks with appropriate specialist) and explain the benefits of the structured workflow approach.

### Team Visibility for Managers

As an Engineering Manager, I want visibility into workflow adherence patterns across my team, so that I can identify training opportunities and measure the effectiveness of our AI-augmented development processes.

The system should provide dashboard metrics showing compliance rates, common violation patterns, and productivity impact measurements across team members.

### ROI Tracking for Product Management

As a Product Manager, I want to track how workflow enforcement impacts development velocity and error rates, so that I can demonstrate the ROI of our structured development approach and optimize team processes.

The analytics should show before/after productivity metrics and clear correlation between workflow compliance and the 30% productivity improvement goal.

## Spec Scope

1. **Direct Modification Detection** - Implement real-time monitoring that detects when users attempt to modify files directly in the main Claude session instead of delegating to sub-agents.

2. **Progressive Enforcement System** - Create a three-tier enforcement mechanism with gentle reminders for first violations, clear warnings for repeated violations, and blocking mechanisms for persistent non-compliance.

3. **Claude Code Command Integration** - Integrate with Claude Code's command system to automatically detect when users should be using workflow commands (/execute-tasks, /plan-product) instead of direct modifications.

4. **Smart Override Mechanisms** - Provide authorized override capabilities for legitimate edge cases (emergency fixes, configuration updates) while maintaining audit trails and requiring justification.

5. **Comprehensive Analytics Dashboard** - Track workflow adherence metrics, violation patterns, productivity impact, and enforcement effectiveness to validate the 30% productivity improvement goal.

## Out of Scope

- Integration with external ticketing systems beyond existing MCP servers
- Real-time collaboration features or multi-user session management  
- Automated code generation or AI-powered code suggestions
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines or deployment automation
- Custom authentication systems beyond existing Claude Code authentication

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Workflow Enforcement Active** - Users attempting direct file modifications in main Claude session receive appropriate progressive enforcement (reminder/warning/blocking) with clear guidance to use sub-agent delegation instead.

2. **Analytics Dashboard Functional** - Engineering managers can view real-time metrics showing workflow adherence rates, violation patterns, and productivity impact measurements through a dedicated dashboard interface.

3. **Command Integration Working** - The system automatically detects when users should be using structured commands (/execute-tasks, /plan-product) and provides contextual suggestions with smooth transitions to proper workflow patterns.
