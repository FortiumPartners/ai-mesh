description: Take a Technical Requirements Document (TRD) generated by /prd-to-trd and delegate to ai-mesh-orchestrator for complete implementation, review, and testing by specialized sub-agents
---

## Mission

This command takes a comprehensive Technical Requirements Document (TRD) and delegates the complete implementation to the ai-mesh-orchestrator, which performs strategic request analysis and routes to tech-lead-orchestrator for structured development methodology including planning, architecture validation, task breakdown, development loops, code review, testing, and deployment.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: TRD Analysis & Validation
1. **TRD Ingestion**: Parse and analyze existing TRD document
2. **Technical Feasibility Review**: Validate implementation approach and architecture
3. **Resource Assessment**: Identify required specialist agents and tools
4. **Context Preparation**: Prepare TRD for implementation delegation

### Phase 2: AI Mesh Orchestrator Delegation
1. **Strategic Request Analysis**: ai-mesh-orchestrator performs strategic analysis of TRD implementation requirements
2. **Development Project Classification**: Identifies as "development_project" requiring full methodology
3. **Tech Lead Orchestrator Delegation**: Routes to tech-lead-orchestrator for complete traditional development methodology
4. **Implementation Orchestration**: tech-lead-orchestrator manages planning, architecture, task breakdown, development loops, and quality gates
5. **Specialist Agent Coordination**: tech-lead-orchestrator delegates to appropriate specialist agents based on technical requirements

### Phase 3: Complete Development Methodology
1. **Planning & Architecture Validation**: Validate TRD architecture against current system constraints
2. **Task Breakdown & Sprint Planning**: Convert TRD tasks into actionable development sprints
3. **Implementation Loops**: Iterative development with continuous integration and testing
4. **Quality Gates**: Code review, security scanning, performance validation, and DoD enforcement
5. **Testing & Validation**: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E testing, and performance benchmarking
6. **Documentation & Deployment**: Update documentation, create deployment procedures, and production readiness

## Expected TRD Input Format

This command expects a TRD generated by `/prd-to-trd` with the following structure:

### Required Sections
- **System Architecture**: Component design, data flow, and integration points
- **Technical Specifications**: APIs, data contracts, performance requirements
- **Implementation Tasks**: Detailed task breakdown with estimates (2-8 hour tasks)
- **Quality Requirements**: Security, performance, accessibility, and testing standards
- **Sprint Planning**: Organized development phases with dependencies
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable validation criteria for each component

### Example TRD Reference
See `/docs/TRD/python-to-nodejs-hooks-conversion-trd.md` for a complete example of the expected TRD format that this command processes.

## Usage Examples

### Using TRD from prd-to-trd Command
```
# First, convert PRD to TRD
/prd-to-trd /docs/PRD/python-to-nodejs-hooks-conversion.md
# Output: /docs/TRD/python-to-nodejs-hooks-conversion-trd.md

# Then implement the TRD
/implement-trd /docs/TRD/python-to-nodejs-hooks-conversion-trd.md
```

## Agent Delegation Flow

```
User Request → implement-trd /path/to/trd.md
    ↓
Read and Parse TRD Document
    ↓
Validate TRD Completeness and Technical Specifications
    ↓
Task(ai-mesh-orchestrator, "Analyze this validated TRD and delegate to tech-lead-orchestrator for complete development methodology implementation")
    ↓
ai-mesh-orchestrator performs strategic request analysis:
  • Classifies as "development_project" requiring full methodology
  • Assesses scope as comprehensive implementation project  
  • Determines strategic delegation to tech-lead-orchestrator needed
    ↓
ai-mesh-orchestrator delegates to tech-lead-orchestrator with complete TRD context
    ↓
tech-lead-orchestrator follows complete development methodology:
  • Phase 1: Plan & Requirements (validate TRD architecture and constraints)
  • Phase 2: Architecture & Design (system design validation and refinement)
  • Phase 3: Task Breakdown (convert TRD tasks into actionable development sprints)
  • Implementation Loops: Iterative development with specialist agent delegation
  • Quality Gates: Code review, testing, security scanning, performance validation
  • Deployment: Production readiness and deployment procedures
    ↓
tech-lead-orchestrator delegates to specialist agents based on TRD requirements:
  • frontend-developer: UI/UX implementation with accessibility compliance
  • backend-developer: Server-side logic, APIs, and database integration
  • react-component-architect: React-specific patterns and state management
  • rails-backend-expert: Rails MVC, ActiveRecord, and background jobs  
  • nestjs-backend-expert: Node.js backend with NestJS framework
  • test-runner: Unit and integration test implementation
  • playwright-tester: E2E testing and browser automation
  • code-reviewer: Security scanning and DoD enforcement
  • git-workflow: Version control and deployment procedures
    ↓
Return complete implementation status and deployment readiness
```

## Strategic Delegation Logic

Based on ai-mesh-orchestrator's delegation framework:

```
IF request_type == "development_project" AND requires_full_methodology
  → DELEGATE to tech-lead-orchestrator
  (Handles: planning, architecture, task breakdown, development loops, quality gates)

TRD Implementation Classification:
  • request_type: "development_project" (comprehensive technical implementation)
  • requires_full_methodology: TRUE (complete system implementation from TRD)
  • scope: Multi-component system requiring orchestrated development approach  
  • complexity: Strategic (orchestration needed for coordinated implementation)
```

## Success Criteria

- **TRD Validation**: TRD parsed and validated for technical completeness
- **Architecture Implementation**: System components built according to TRD specifications
- **Quality Standards**: All DoD requirements met with security and performance validation
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing (unit ≥80%, integration ≥70%, E2E coverage)

## Performance Monitoring

The ai-mesh-orchestrator will track implementation performance using agent activity tracking:

- **Task Completion Times**: Monitor specialist agent performance against TRD estimates
- **Quality Metrics**: Track code review findings, test coverage, and performance benchmarks  
- **Integration Success**: Measure handoff efficiency between specialist agents
- **User Satisfaction**: Validate implementation meets TRD acceptance criteria

## Implementation Example

Using the Python to Node.js hooks conversion TRD (`/docs/TRD/python-to-nodejs-hooks-conversion-trd.md`), the command would:

1. **Parse TRD sections**: Extract architecture design, implementation tasks, quality requirements
2. **Validate technical feasibility**: Ensure Node.js conversion approach is sound
3. **Delegate to ai-mesh-orchestrator**: Route TRD with full implementation context
4. **Orchestrate implementation**:
   - backend-developer: Convert analytics-engine.py → analytics-engine.js
   - file-creator: Create Node.js project structure and configuration
   - test-runner: Implement unit tests for statistical functions
   - code-reviewer: Security review and performance validation  
   - playwright-tester: Integration testing with Claude Code lifecycle
   - documentation-specialist: Update installation guides and documentation
   - git-workflow: Create feature branch, commits, and deployment-ready PR
5. **Quality validation**: Verify ≤50ms hook execution, backward compatibility, zero Python dependencies
6. **Production delivery**: Complete Node.js hooks implementation ready for deployment
