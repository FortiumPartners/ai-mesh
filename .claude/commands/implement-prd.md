description: Take an existing PRD (generated by /plan-product) and delegate to tech-lead-orchestrator for technical requirements, architecture design, and implementation planning
---

## Mission

This command takes a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) created by the `/plan-product` command and delegates it to the tech-lead-orchestrator via ai-mesh-orchestrator for technical planning, architecture design, and implementation breakdown.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: PRD Analysis & Validation
1. **PRD Ingestion**: Parse and analyze existing PRD document
2. **Requirements Validation**: Ensure completeness of functional and non-functional requirements
3. **Acceptance Criteria Review**: Validate testable acceptance criteria
4. **Context Preparation**: Prepare PRD for technical planning delegation

### Phase 2: Agent Mesh Delegation
1. **AI Mesh Orchestrator**: Route validated PRD to ai-mesh-orchestrator
2. **Tech Lead Orchestrator**: Delegate technical planning and architecture design
3. **TRD Generation**: Generate Technical Requirements Document (TRD)
4. **Task Breakdown**: Create actionable development tasks with estimates
5. **Implementation Planning**: Develop sprint planning and dependency mapping

## Expected PRD Input Format

This command expects a PRD generated by `/plan-product` with the following structure:

### Required Sections
- **Product Summary**: Problem statement, solution overview, value proposition
- **User Analysis**: Primary users, personas, pain points, user journey
- **Goals & Non-Goals**: Primary objectives, success criteria, scope boundaries
- **Technical Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable success criteria with test scenarios
- **Implementation Planning**: Phases, timeline, constraints
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical and business risks with mitigation strategies

### Example PRD Reference
See `/docs/PRD/python-to-nodejs-hooks-conversion.md` for a complete example of the expected PRD format that this command processes.

## Usage Examples

### Using Existing PRD File
```
/implement-prd /docs/PRD/python-to-nodejs-hooks-conversion.md
```

### Using PRD from plan-product Command
```
# First, generate PRD with plan-product
/plan-product "Convert Python hooks to Node.js for simplified installation"

# Then implement with the generated PRD
/implement-prd /docs/PRD/python-hooks-conversion-prd.md
```

### Multiple PRDs Implementation
```
/implement-prd /docs/PRD/user-authentication-system.md
/implement-prd /docs/PRD/analytics-dashboard.md
/implement-prd /docs/PRD/real-time-collaboration.md
```

## Agent Delegation Flow

```
User Request → implement-prd /path/to/existing-prd.md
    ↓
Read and Parse Existing PRD Document
    ↓
Validate PRD Completeness and Format
    ↓
Task(ai-mesh-orchestrator, "Take this validated PRD and delegate to tech-lead-orchestrator for complete technical planning, architecture design, and implementation breakdown")
    ↓
ai-mesh-orchestrator analyzes PRD requirements and delegates to tech-lead-orchestrator
    ↓
tech-lead-orchestrator follows Phase 1-3 methodology:
  • Phase 1: Plan & Requirements Analysis
  • Phase 2: Architecture Design 
  • Phase 3: Task Breakdown & Sprint Planning
    ↓
Return complete TRD, architecture design, and implementation tasks to user
```

## Success Criteria

- **PRD Validation**: Existing PRD parsed and validated for completeness
- **Technical Requirements**: TRD generated with system architecture and constraints
- **Task Breakdown**: Development tasks with 2-8 hour estimates and dependencies
- **Sprint Planning**: Organized sprints with clear deliverables and quality gates
- **Implementation Ready**: Complete technical plan suitable for development team handoff

## Integration Points

- **Plan-Product Integration**: Designed to work with PRDs generated by `/plan-product` command
- **AgentOS Standards**: Follows TRD template from docs/agentos/TRD.md
- **Context7 Integration**: Pulls relevant technical documentation and examples
- **Linear Integration**: Creates technical epics and implementation stories
- **Git Workflow Integration**: Generates branch strategy and commit planning

## Quality Gates

- PRD format and completeness validation
- Requirements technical feasibility assessment  
- Acceptance criteria implementation validation
- Architecture design review and approval
- Task breakdown granularity verification (2-8 hour tasks)
- Sprint dependency mapping validation

## Implementation Example

Using the Python to Node.js hooks conversion PRD (`/docs/PRD/python-to-nodejs-hooks-conversion.md`), the command would:

1. **Parse PRD sections**: Extract user analysis, technical requirements, acceptance criteria
2. **Validate completeness**: Ensure all required sections present and detailed
3. **Delegate to tech-lead-orchestrator**: Route PRD with full context for technical planning
4. **Generate outputs**: 
   - Technical Requirements Document (TRD)
   - System architecture design
   - Task breakdown (analytics-engine.py → analytics-engine.js conversion, etc.)
   - Sprint planning with 5-week timeline
   - Quality gates and testing strategy

## Notes

- Expects PRD input from `/plan-product` command or compatible format
- Validates PRD completeness before technical delegation
- Leverages tech-lead-orchestrator's full Phase 1-3 methodology
- Maintains traceability from PRD requirements through implementation tasks
- Integrates with existing agent mesh for specialized technical planning
