# Python to Node.js Hooks Conversion - Technical Planning Request

## Request Overview
**Type**: Technical Planning and Implementation Breakdown
**Delegated To**: tech-lead-orchestrator
**Date**: 2025-09-05
**Priority**: High

## PRD Summary
**Project**: Convert Python-based productivity analytics hooks to Node.js
**Goal**: Eliminate Python dependencies while maintaining 100% functionality
**Users**: Software developers, engineering managers, DevOps engineers
**Success Metrics**: 30% productivity increase, 50% error reduction, <60s installation time
**Timeline**: 5-week implementation across 5 phases

## Key Technical Requirements
- Convert analytics-engine.py → analytics-engine.js (productivity scoring, anomaly detection)
- Convert hook scripts: session-start.py, session-end.py, tool-metrics.py → .js equivalents
- Replace numpy/pandas with JavaScript equivalents (simple-statistics, lodash)
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing metrics data
- Performance requirements: ≤50ms hook execution, ≤2s analytics processing
- Security: no external network requests, appropriate file permissions

## Acceptance Criteria
- Zero Python dependencies required
- All analytics features operational in Node.js
- Performance parity or better than Python implementation
- Existing metrics data preserved and accessible
- Complete installation under 60 seconds

## Deliverables Requested
1. **Technical Requirements Document (TRD)** - Complete system architecture and technical specifications
2. **System Architecture Design** - Component diagrams, data flow, integration points
3. **Implementation Task Breakdown** - Detailed tasks with estimates and skill requirements
4. **Sprint Planning** - 5-phase breakdown with dependencies and milestones
5. **Quality Gates & Testing Strategy** - Validation criteria and testing approaches

## Context
This is part of the Fortium Claude Configuration toolkit's evolution to eliminate external dependencies while maintaining the proven 30% productivity improvements. The conversion should follow tech-lead-orchestrator's Phase 1-3 methodology for comprehensive technical planning.

## Expected Outputs
- Detailed TRD suitable for development team handoff
- Architecture documentation with component specifications
- Sprint-ready task breakdown with effort estimates
- Quality assurance framework with testing strategy
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
