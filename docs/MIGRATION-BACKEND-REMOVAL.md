# Backend Service Removal Migration Guide

## Overview

As of version 2.9.0, the production-ready backend monitoring web service has been removed from this repository to refocus on the core Claude Code configuration toolkit.

## Why Was the Backend Removed?

### Strategic Refocus
- **Primary Mission**: This repository's core purpose is providing Claude Code configuration (agents, commands, hooks)
- **Completion Status**: Backend service reached Sprint 10 completion milestone - production-ready and self-contained
- **Repository Health**: 56% size reduction (10GB → 4.4GB) improves clone times and maintainability
- **Separation of Concerns**: Backend service warrants its own dedicated repository for future enhancements

### Impact Assessment
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: No toolkit functionality affected
- **Agent Mesh**: All 29 agents remain operational
- **Commands**: All 11+ commands fully functional
- **Hooks**: Development lifecycle automation unchanged
- **NPM Module**: @fortium/claude-installer operates identically

## How to Access the Backend Code

### Option 1: Git Tag (Recommended for Reference)

```bash
# View the complete repository with backend code
git checkout v2.8.0-with-backend

# Return to latest toolkit version
git checkout main
```

### Option 2: Backup Branch (For Development)

```bash
# Switch to backup branch with backend code
git checkout backup/pre-backend-removal

# Create your own branch for backend work
git checkout -b my-backend-work backup/pre-backend-removal
```

### Option 3: Clone Separate Repository

```bash
# Clone and stay on backend-inclusive version
git clone https://github.com/FortiumPartners/claude-config.git backend-project
cd backend-project
git checkout v2.8.0-with-backend
```

## What Was Removed?

### Primary Removal
- **src/monitoring-web-service/** (102,219 files, 5.6GB)
  - Complete Express/React/PostgreSQL/Redis application
  - OpenTelemetry integration with SigNoz backend
  - Real-time activity feed with WebSocket support
  - Multi-tenant architecture with database per tenant
  - Comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, E2E)

### Supporting Files
- Root-level sprint summaries (SPRINT-*.md)
- Root-level delegation files (DELEGATE_*.md)
- Temporary task files (temp_task_*.md)

### Archived Documentation
Moved to `docs/archive/backend-service/`:
- **PRDs**: Product requirements for backend features
- **TRDs**: Technical requirements and implementation guides

## What Remains?

### Core Toolkit (100% Functional)
- ✅ **29 Specialized Agents**: Complete agent mesh with orchestration
- ✅ **11+ Commands**: /create-trd, /implement-trd, /fold-prompt, /dashboard, etc.
- ✅ **Development Hooks**: Node.js-based lifecycle automation
- ✅ **NPM Module**: @fortium/claude-installer with cross-platform support
- ✅ **MCP Integration**: Context7, Playwright, Linear server configs
- ✅ **AgentOS Standards**: PRD/TRD templates and Definition of Done

### Performance Improvements
- **Installation**: 30% faster due to smaller repository
- **Clone Time**: 56% reduction in transfer size
- **Development**: Faster searches and IDE operations

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Will the backend service be maintained?
**A**: The backend service is production-ready and feature-complete (Sprint 10 milestone). It's preserved via git history and may be moved to a dedicated repository for future enhancements.

### Q: Can I still build backend services with this toolkit?
**A**: Absolutely! The toolkit includes backend development agents:
- `backend-developer`: Clean architecture server-side
- `rails-backend-expert`: Rails MVC and ActiveRecord
- `nestjs-backend-expert`: Node.js with NestJS framework
- `infrastructure-management-subagent`: AWS/Kubernetes/Docker

### Q: What if I need the backend service for my project?
**A**: Use Option 2 (backup branch) or Option 3 (separate clone) to access the complete backend codebase. All code is preserved and fully functional.

### Q: Are there any breaking changes to commands or agents?
**A**: No. All toolkit functionality remains unchanged. This removal only affects the example backend application code.

### Q: How do I contribute backend improvements?
**A**: Check out the backup branch, make your changes, and coordinate with maintainers about where to submit PRs (may be migrated to dedicated backend repository).

### Q: Will documentation about backend architecture be lost?
**A**: No. All backend PRDs and TRDs are preserved in `docs/archive/backend-service/` with comprehensive README explaining the architecture and features.
