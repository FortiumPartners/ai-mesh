# Technical Requirements Document (TRD)
## Infrastructure Management Subagent

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: September 6, 2025  
**PRD Reference**: [Infrastructure-Subagent-PRD.md](../PRD/Infrastructure-Subagent-PRD.md)  
**Status**: Implementation Ready  
**Implementation Timeline**: 6 weeks (3 sprints × 2 weeks)  

---

## Executive Summary

This TRD outlines the complete technical implementation for the **Infrastructure Management Subagent** - a specialized AI agent that will provide expert-level automation for Kubernetes configurations, Terraform AWS modules, Docker containerization, and infrastructure orchestration within our existing 25+ agent mesh ecosystem.

**Problem Solved**: Development teams currently experience 2-3 day infrastructure setup delays, inconsistent configurations, and security vulnerabilities in manually created infrastructure.

**Technical Solution**: A specialized infrastructure subagent that integrates seamlessly with our existing agent mesh, providing automated infrastructure design, configuration generation, and deployment orchestration while enforcing best practices and security standards.

**Success Metrics**: 70% faster infrastructure provisioning (2-3 days → 4-6 hours), 90% first-time deployment success rate, 100% security compliance, 30% cost reduction.
