> **Priority**: High  
> **Related PRD**: docs/PRD/claude-hooks-installer-prd.md

## Executive Summary

This TRD provides comprehensive technical specifications for implementing an automated installation script (`install-metrics-hooks.sh`) that transforms the manual Claude hooks installation process into a single-command operation. The system automates Claude settings.json modification, hooks directory setup, Node.js dependencies installation, and provides seamless migration from existing Python hooks.

### Technical Objectives

- **Automation**: Single script execution automates entire installation process
- **Safety**: Comprehensive backup and rollback mechanisms protect user configuration
- **Migration**: Seamless transition from Python to Node.js hooks with data preservation
- **Validation**: Built-in testing and validation ensures installation success
- **Performance**: Sub-60-second installation with minimal system impact

## System Architecture

### Overview

The installation system consists of modular components orchestrated through a main installation script. Each component handles a specific aspect of the installation process with comprehensive error handling and validation.
