**After (v3.1.0)**:
- Total agents: 29 (17% reduction)
- Framework-specialist agents: 0 (100% eliminated)
- Framework expertise: Centralized in modular skills
- Maintenance burden: Low (15 minutes per framework update)

**Impact**:
- **63% reduction in framework agent definitions**
- **50% faster framework updates** (15 min vs 3 hours)
- **17% overall agent count reduction** (35 → 29 agents)

- Time required: 3 hours (30 min × 6 agents)
- Risk: Inconsistencies across agents
- Testing: 6 separate validation paths

**After Skills-Based Architecture**:
- Framework updates: Edit 1 skill directory (SKILL.md, REFERENCE.md, templates)
- Time required: 15 minutes (single source of truth)
- Risk: Consistency guaranteed (single skill per framework)
- Testing: 1 validation path per skill

**Cost Savings**:
- Developer time: 50% reduction (15 min vs 3 hours)
- Testing effort: 83% reduction (1 skill vs 6 agents)

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users (Framework-Specialist Agent Users)

**Current State (v3.0.x)**:
- Using framework-specialist agents (nestjs-backend-expert, phoenix-expert, etc.)
- Manual framework selection required
- Framework expertise embedded in agent definitions

**Target State (v3.1.0)**:
- Use generic agents (backend-developer, frontend-developer) with skills
- Automatic framework detection
- Framework expertise in modular skill files

### Migration Steps

**Option 1: Hard Cutover (Recommended)**

1. **Update to v3.1.0**:
   ```bash
   # Pull latest claude-config
   git pull origin main

   # Verify new agents and skills are present
   ls ~/.claude/agents/backend-developer.yaml
   ls ~/.claude/skills/nestjs-framework/
   ```

2. **Test Framework Detection**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to a project
   cd /path/to/your/nestjs/project

   # Start a task - framework should auto-detect
   # No manual framework specification needed
   ```

3. **Verify Skill Loading**:
   - First task may take ~18ms to load skill (cold)
   - Subsequent tasks use cached skill (0.09ms)
   - Check for any detection issues (confidence should be >0.8)

4. **Optional: Manual Override**:
   ```bash
   # If detection fails or you want to override
   claude --framework=nestjs "Create user controller"
   ```

**Option 2: Gradual Rollout (Conservative)**

1. **Phase 1: Test on Non-Critical Projects** (Week 1)
   - Use v3.1.0 on personal projects or non-production work
   - Verify framework detection accuracy
   - Report any issues to team

2. **Phase 2: Pilot with Small Team** (Week 2-3)
   - Roll out to 2-3 developers
   - Collect feedback on detection and code quality
   - Document any workarounds needed

3. **Phase 3: Full Team Rollout** (Week 4+)
   - Deploy to entire team once validated
   - Monitor for issues in first week
   - Switch to v3.1.0 as default

**Option 3: Keep Framework-Specialist Agents (Not Recommended)**

If you prefer to keep using framework-specialist agents:
- They remain functional in v3.1.0 (backward compatible)
- Will be removed in v3.2.0 (6 months)
- Consider migrating before v3.2.0 release

### Rollback Procedure

If issues arise, rollback is simple:

```bash
# Revert to v3.0.x
git checkout v3.0.x-pre-skills-migration

# Restore original agents
cp -r backup/agents-v3.0.x/ ~/.claude/agents/

# Remove skills infrastructure
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/

# Restart Claude Code
# Framework-specialist agents will work as before
```

**Estimated Rollback Time**: 30 minutes
