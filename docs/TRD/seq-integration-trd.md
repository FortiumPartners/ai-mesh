**Author**: Technical Architecture Team  
**Project**: Monitoring Web Service Seq Integration  
**PRD Reference**: [docs/PRD/seq-integration-prd.md](../PRD/seq-integration-prd.md)

## System Context & Constraints

### Current Architecture

**Backend Stack:**
- Node.js 18+ with TypeScript 5.2+
- Express.js 4.18+ with middleware-based architecture
- Winston 3.11+ for existing logging infrastructure
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL database
- Redis for caching and session management

**Frontend Stack:**
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Vite build system
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Axios for HTTP client
- React Router for navigation
- Socket.io-client for real-time features

**Infrastructure:**

### Technical Constraints

**Framework Requirements:**
- Must integrate with existing Winston logging infrastructure
- Cannot modify core Express.js middleware chain order
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing log statements
- Frontend logging must work with Vite dev server and production builds

**Infrastructure Limitations:**
- Development: Single Seq instance acceptable
- Production: Seq must support clustering and high availability
- Log retention: 30 days default, configurable per environment
- Network: All log transmission must use TLS 1.3

**Security Policies:**
- No sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII) in logs
- Access control via role-based permissions
- Audit trail for all administrative actions
- SOC 2 compliance for production logs

**Performance Requirements:**
- Backend: <5ms overhead per log entry (P95)
- Frontend: <1% impact on page load times
- Log ingestion: 10,000+ entries per minute
- Seq availability: 99.9% uptime SLA

### Data Flow Diagrams

#### 1. Backend Request Logging Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Express
    participant Correlation
    participant Winston
    participant Seq
    participant DB
    
    Client->>Express: HTTP Request
    Express->>Correlation: Generate/Extract Correlation ID
    Correlation->>Winston: Log Request Start
    Winston->>Seq: Send Structured Log
    Express->>DB: Execute Business Logic
    DB-->>Express: Response
    Express->>Winston: Log Request Complete
    Winston->>Seq: Send Response Log
    Express-->>Client: HTTP Response
```

#### 2. Frontend Error Logging Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant React
    participant ErrorBoundary
    participant Logger
    participant Buffer
    participant API
    participant Seq
    
    User->>React: User Action
    React->>React: JavaScript Error
    React->>ErrorBoundary: Catch Error
    ErrorBoundary->>Logger: Log Error with Context
    Logger->>Buffer: Store Log Entry
    Buffer->>API: Batch Send Logs
    API->>Seq: Forward to Seq Server
```

### Integration Patterns

**Correlation ID Propagation:**
- Frontend generates UUID v4 for each user session
- Each API request includes correlation ID in headers
- Backend extracts and includes in all log entries
- Database operations tagged with correlation ID

**Log Level Mapping:**
- Frontend: Debug → Information, Error → Error, Fatal → Fatal
- Backend: All Winston levels map directly to Seq levels
- Automatic log level filtering based on environment

**Buffering Strategy:**
- Frontend: 100 entries or 30 seconds, whichever comes first
- Backend: Direct streaming with circuit breaker fallback
- Offline handling: LocalStorage buffer with 1MB limit

## Interfaces & Data Contracts

### API Specifications

#### Backend Log Ingestion Endpoint

**POST /api/v1/logs**

Request Schema:
```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
