# Technical Requirements Document (TRD)
## Fly.io Infrastructure Integration

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-10-25
**PRD Reference**: [flyio-infrastructure-integration.md](../PRD/flyio-infrastructure-integration.md)
**Status**: Implementation Ready
**Implementation Timeline**: 4 weeks (4 sprints × 1 week)

---

## Executive Summary

This TRD outlines the complete technical implementation for **Fly.io Infrastructure Integration** - comprehensive Fly.io support for the infrastructure-developer agent through a skills-based architecture that matches our proven Helm and Kubernetes integration patterns. This enhancement enables developers to deploy applications to Fly.io's modern PaaS platform with the same ease and AI assistance currently available for AWS/Kubernetes deployments.

**Problem Solved**: Development teams lack AI-augmented support for Fly.io deployments, forcing manual configuration of fly.toml files, deployment scripts, and security patterns without best practice guidance. This creates a 2-3 hour deployment setup burden and increases configuration errors.

**Technical Solution**: A comprehensive Fly.io skills package (`skills/flyio/`) integrated with our existing tooling detection system, providing automated fly.toml generation, Dockerfile optimization, multi-environment support, and security-first deployment patterns. The infrastructure-developer agent will auto-detect Fly.io projects and load appropriate skills, maintaining 100% compatibility with existing AWS/K8s workflows.

**Success Metrics**: 60% deployment speed increase (2-3 hours → 30-45 minutes), 90% first-time deployment success, 95%+ detection accuracy, sub-10ms detection performance, 100% security compliance, 85% self-service adoption.

## Next Steps for Implementation

### Immediate Actions (Week 1 - Sprint 1)

1. **Sprint 1 Kickoff**: Begin with SKILL.md creation (TRD-001 to TRD-010)
2. **REFERENCE.md Development**: Create comprehensive guide with examples (TRD-011 to TRD-021)
3. **Example Templates**: Build production-ready templates (TRD-022 to TRD-031)
4. **Quality Validation**: Ensure all Sprint 1 deliverables meet acceptance criteria

### Sprint Progression (Weeks 2-4)

1. **Sprint 2**: Detection system integration and infrastructure-developer enhancement
2. **Sprint 3**: Production hardening, security validation, and beta testing
3. **Sprint 4**: Production deployment, monitoring, training, and support

### Quality Gates

1. **After Sprint 1**: Skills content complete and validated
2. **After Sprint 2**: Detection system working with 95%+ accuracy
3. **After Sprint 3**: Beta testing successful with >4/5 satisfaction
4. **After Sprint 4**: Production deployment successful with metrics validation

### Success Validation

1. **User Acceptance Testing**: Validate with all personas (developers, DevOps, platform engineers)
2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Confirm all performance targets met
3. **Security Validation**: Pass security audit with zero high-severity findings
4. **Documentation Review**: Ensure comprehensive documentation and training materials
