1. **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns enabled parallel testing
2. **Test-First Approach**: Comprehensive unit tests caught design issues early
3. **E2E Validation**: Integration tests validated complete workflow assumptions
4. **Documentation**: Clear JSDoc comments improved code maintainability

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Complexity Routing**: Initially planned framework-only routing, expanded to include complexity-based logic
