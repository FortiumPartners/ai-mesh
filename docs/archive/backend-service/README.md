# Backend Monitoring Web Service - Archive

## Overview

This directory contains the archived Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and Technical Requirements Documents (TRDs) for the **Backend Monitoring Web Service** that was developed as part of the Claude Code Configuration Toolkit project.

## Archival Date

**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Version**: v2.9.0  
**Git Tag**: `v2.8.0-with-backend` (last version with backend code)  
**Backup Branch**: `backup/pre-backend-removal`

## Why Was the Backend Archived?

The backend monitoring web service was completed as a **production-ready, self-contained application** during Sprint 10. It was removed from this repository to:

1. **Focus Repository Purpose**: This repository is the Claude Code Configuration Toolkit (agents, commands, hooks)
2. **Reduce Repository Size**: Backend service was 5.6GB (102,219 files) - 56% of total repository
3. **Improve Installation Speed**: Smaller repository = faster cloning and installation
4. **Simplify Maintenance**: Toolkit and backend service have different lifecycles
5. **Preserve Full History**: All work preserved via git tags and backup branches

## Project Status

The backend monitoring web service achieved **100% completion** of all planned features:

- ✅ Sprint 1: Seq Logging Integration
- ✅ Sprint 2: Authentication & User Management
- ✅ Sprint 3: Metrics Collection & Storage
- ✅ Sprint 4: Business Metrics & Instrumentation
- ✅ Sprint 5: Alert Rules & Monitoring
- ✅ Sprint 6: Multi-tenant Architecture
- ✅ Sprint 7: Real-Time Activity Feed
- ✅ Sprint 8-9: OpenTelemetry Migration
- ✅ Sprint 10: Production Hardening & Deployment

**Final Status**: Production-ready with comprehensive testing, monitoring, and deployment automation.

## Accessing the Backend Code

### Option 1: Git Tag (Recommended)

View the complete backend service at the time of removal:

```bash
# Check out the tagged version
git checkout v2.8.0-with-backend

# Browse the backend code
cd src/monitoring-web-service

# Return to latest version
git checkout main
```

### Option 2: Backup Branch

Access the backup branch created before removal:

```bash
# Check out the backup branch
git checkout backup/pre-backend-removal

# Browse the backend code
cd src/monitoring-web-service

# Return to latest version
git checkout main
```

### Option 3: Git History

View the complete development history:

```bash
# View commits affecting the backend
git log --all -- src/monitoring-web-service

# View a specific file's history
git log --follow src/monitoring-web-service/README.md

# Show changes in a specific commit
git show <commit-hash>
```

## What Was Preserved?

The core Claude Code Configuration Toolkit remains fully intact:

- **29 Specialized Agents** - Complete agent mesh for development workflows
- **11+ Slash Commands** - TRD-driven development, product planning, project analysis
- **Development Hooks** - Local-only metrics collection and automation
- **NPM Installer** - Professional cross-platform installation
- **Documentation** - AgentOS standards, agent guides, command references

## Impact on Users

**Zero Breaking Changes**:
- All toolkit functionality preserved
- Hooks continue working (local storage mode)
- All agents and commands operational
- Both NPM and bash installers work correctly

## Related Sprint Summaries

Sprint completion summaries were also removed from the repository root. These can be accessed via:

```bash
# View Sprint 10 completion summary
git show v2.8.0-with-backend:src/monitoring-web-service/SPRINT-10-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md

# View Sprint 1 implementation
git show v2.8.0-with-backend:SPRINT-1-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md
```

## Migration Guide

For users who were using the backend service:

1. **No Action Required**: Existing installations continue to work
2. **Accessing Code**: Use git tag `v2.8.0-with-backend` to view complete backend
3. **Deploying Backend**: The backend was production-ready and can be deployed independently
4. **Documentation**: All backend docs preserved in this archive
