## Database Schema Design

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

**Strategy**: Schema-per-tenant approach for complete data isolation

```sql
-- Master tenant registry
CREATE TABLE tenants (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    domain VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    schema_name VARCHAR(63) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    subscription_plan VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'basic',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

-- Per-tenant schema structure (template)
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS tenant_template;

-- Users table (per tenant)
CREATE TABLE tenant_template.users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'developer',
    sso_provider VARCHAR(50),
    sso_user_id VARCHAR(255),
    last_login TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Metrics sessions (per tenant)
CREATE TABLE tenant_template.metrics_sessions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES tenant_template.users(id),
    session_start TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    session_end TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    total_duration_ms BIGINT,
    tools_used JSONB,
    productivity_score INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Tool usage metrics (per tenant)
CREATE TABLE tenant_template.tool_metrics (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    session_id UUID REFERENCES tenant_template.metrics_sessions(id),
    tool_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    execution_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    total_duration_ms BIGINT NOT NULL,
    success_rate DECIMAL(5,4) NOT NULL,
    error_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Dashboard configurations (per tenant)
CREATE TABLE tenant_template.dashboard_configs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES tenant_template.users(id),
    dashboard_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    widget_layout JSONB NOT NULL,
    is_default BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Indexes and Performance Optimization

```sql
-- Performance indexes (per tenant schema)
CREATE INDEX idx_metrics_sessions_user_date ON tenant_template.metrics_sessions(user_id, session_start);
CREATE INDEX idx_tool_metrics_session ON tenant_template.tool_metrics(session_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tool_metrics_name_date ON tenant_template.tool_metrics(tool_name, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON tenant_template.users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_sso ON tenant_template.users(sso_provider, sso_user_id);
```

}
```

---

## Authentication & Authorization

### SSO Integration

**Supported Providers**:
- Google Workspace (OAuth 2.0)
- Microsoft Azure AD (SAML 2.0)
- Okta (SAML 2.0/OAuth 2.0)
- Generic OIDC providers

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// SSO configuration per tenant
const ssoConfig = {
  provider: 'google', // or 'azure', 'okta', 'generic'
  clientId: 'tenant-specific-client-id',
  clientSecret: 'encrypted-client-secret',
  redirectUri: 'https://app.metrics.com/auth/callback',
  scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email']
};
```

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Role Hierarchy**:
- **Super Admin**: Multi-tenant system management
- **Tenant Admin**: Full tenant configuration and user management
- **Manager**: Team analytics and user performance views
- **Developer**: Personal metrics and team participation
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to assigned dashboards

**Permission Matrix**:
```javascript
const permissions = {
  'super_admin': ['*'],
  'tenant_admin': ['user.manage', 'dashboard.manage', 'metrics.view_all'],
  'manager': ['metrics.view_team', 'dashboard.view', 'reports.export'],
  'developer': ['metrics.view_own', 'dashboard.personal', 'profile.edit'],
  'viewer': ['dashboard.view', 'reports.view']
};
```

---

## MCP Integration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility

**Current Local System**:
- Node.js hooks in `.claude/hooks/`
- Local metrics collection and storage
- Direct file-based analytics

**Hybrid Architecture**:
```javascript
// MCP server with dual mode
class MetricsCollector {
  constructor(config) {
    this.mode = config.remote_enabled ? 'hybrid' : 'local';
    this.localPath = '.claude/hooks/';
    this.remoteEndpoint = config.remote_endpoint;
  }

  async collectMetrics(data) {
    // Always collect locally for reliability
    await this.saveLocal(data);
    
    // Sync to remote when available
    if (this.mode === 'hybrid') {
      try {
        await this.syncRemote(data);
      } catch (error) {
        // Graceful degradation - continue with local
        console.warn('Remote sync failed, continuing locally');
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Migration Strategy

**Phase 1**: Parallel data collection (local + remote)
**Phase 2**: Remote-primary with local fallback
**Phase 3**: Remote-only with local cache

**Performance Requirements**:
- MCP call overhead: <5ms
- Fallback activation: <100ms
- Data sync interval: 5 minutes
- Conflict resolution: remote wins
