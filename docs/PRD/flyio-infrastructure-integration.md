# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Fly.io Infrastructure Integration

## Document Information
- **Product**: Fly.io Infrastructure Skills Integration
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-10-25
- **Status**: Draft
- **Owner**: Fortium AI-Augmented Development Team
- **Stakeholders**: Platform Engineers, DevOps Teams, Application Developers, Infrastructure Teams

## Summary

### Problem Statement

Development teams increasingly choose Fly.io as a modern, developer-friendly platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for deploying applications globally with minimal configuration. However, our infrastructure-developer agent currently lacks specialized Fly.io expertise, forcing developers to:

- **Manual Configuration**: Write fly.toml configurations without AI assistance or best practice guidance
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Navigate Fly.io's unique deployment model (fly machines, regions, networking) without specialized support
- **Context Switching**: Toggle between AWS/Kubernetes workflows and Fly.io patterns without seamless integration
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Deploy applications without standardized templates or security-first configurations

This gap prevents teams from leveraging our AI-augmented development process for Fly.io deployments, reducing productivity and increasing deployment errors.

### Solution Overview

Add comprehensive Fly.io support to the infrastructure-developer agent through:

1. **Fly.io Skills Package**: SKILL.md (quick reference <25KB, <100ms load) + REFERENCE.md (comprehensive guide with 10+ production examples)
2. **Detection System Integration**: Multi-signal detection in tooling-detector with 95%+ accuracy, sub-10ms performance
3. **infrastructure-developer Enhancement**: Auto-detect and load Fly.io skills when fly.toml or Fly.io patterns detected
4. **Security-First Approach**: Secrets management, environment variables, networking best practices by default

This enables developers to deploy to Fly.io with the same ease and confidence as AWS/Kubernetes deployments while maintaining 100% compatibility with existing workflows.

### Business Impact

- **Development Velocity**: 60% reduction in Fly.io deployment setup time (baseline: 2-3 hours → target: 30-45 minutes)
- **Developer Experience**: Simplified PaaS workflows with intelligent automation and error prevention
- **Multi-Cloud Flexibility**: Support both traditional infrastructure (AWS/K8s) and modern PaaS (Fly.io) from single agent
- **Adoption Acceleration**: Lower barrier to entry for teams evaluating Fly.io as deployment platform

- **Target Accuracy**: 95%+ across diverse project types
- **Target Performance**: 1-10ms detection time (sub-10ms requirement)

### infrastructure-developer Agent Enhancement

#### Updated Agent Behavior (agents/infrastructure-developer.yaml)

**New Capability Section**:
```markdown
## Fly.io Platform Expertise

**Auto-Detection**: Loads skills/flyio/ when fly.toml detected or Fly.io patterns identified

**Core Capabilities**:
- fly.toml configuration generation for Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby, Elixir applications
- Multi-environment deployments (dev, staging, production) with region-specific configs
- Dockerfile optimization for Fly.io platform (multi-stage builds, caching strategies)
- Secrets management with Fly.io secrets API and environment variable best practices
- Networking configuration (internal services, private networking, external access)
- Health check setup for zero-downtime deployments and auto-recovery
- Scaling patterns (horizontal scaling, auto-scaling, multi-region distribution)
- Database integration (Fly Postgres, external databases, connection pooling)
- Monitoring and observability (logs, metrics, alerts, distributed tracing)

**When to Use Fly.io vs Kubernetes**:
- **Fly.io**: Simple applications, fast global deployments, minimal ops overhead
- **Kubernetes**: Complex microservices, existing K8s expertise, hybrid cloud requirements
- **Mixed**: Backend on K8s, frontend/edge services on Fly.io
```

#### Integration with Existing Skills

**Priority Order** (when multiple skills detected):
1. **Explicit user request**: User specifies platform preference
2. **Primary detection signal**: Strongest signal wins (fly.toml > Chart.yaml > Dockerfile)
3. **Project context**: Analyze architecture for best platform fit
4. **Cost-performance trade-off**: Recommend based on requirements

**Mixed Infrastructure Support**:
```
Example: Project with both Chart.yaml and fly.toml
→ Load both skills/kubernetes/ and skills/flyio/
→ Provide recommendations for service placement
→ Generate configurations for hybrid deployment
```

## Appendix

### A. Glossary

- **Fly.io Machine**: Isolated VM running application containers with CPU, memory, and storage
- **fly.toml**: Primary configuration file for Fly.io applications
- **Fly Regions**: Geographic locations where applications can be deployed (30+ worldwide)
- **Fly Secrets**: Encrypted environment variables managed by Fly.io secrets API
- **Anycast Networking**: Fly.io's global load balancing routing user requests to nearest region
- **Private Networking**: Internal network for service-to-service communication within Fly.io

### B. Example fly.toml (Node.js Web Application)

```toml
# fly.toml - Node.js Web Application (Production-Ready)

app = "my-nodejs-app"
primary_region = "sea"

[build]
  dockerfile = "Dockerfile"

[env]
  NODE_ENV = "production"
  PORT = "8080"

[http_service]
  internal_port = 8080
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = true
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 1

  [[http_service.checks]]
    grace_period = "10s"
    interval = "30s"
    method = "GET"
    timeout = "5s"
    path = "/health"

[[services]]
  protocol = "tcp"
  internal_port = 8080

  [[services.ports]]
    port = 80
    handlers = ["http"]
    force_https = true

  [[services.ports]]
    port = 443
    handlers = ["tls", "http"]

[processes]
  web = "node server.js"
  worker = "node worker.js"

[[vm]]
  cpu_kind = "shared"
  cpus = 1
  memory_mb = 256
```
