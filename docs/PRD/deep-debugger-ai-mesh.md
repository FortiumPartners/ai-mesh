**Document Status**: Draft  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-10-13  
**Product Manager**: Product Management Orchestrator  
**Technical Lead**: tech-lead-orchestrator  

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines a Deep Debugger implementation for the claude-config ai-mesh system that enables systematic bug recreation, root cause analysis, and resolution through intelligent collaboration with the tech-lead-orchestrator agent. The debugger will transform bug reports into actionable test cases, leverage TDD principles for bug fixes, and provide comprehensive debugging workflows that reduce time-to-resolution by 70%.

## Product Context

### Current State Analysis

The current claude-config ecosystem provides:
- 32+ specialized agents for development workflows
- TRD-driven development pipeline with checkbox tracking
- AgentOS standards with Definition of Done enforcement
- tech-lead-orchestrator for development methodology coordination
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure (test-runner, playwright-tester, code-reviewer)

**Gap**: No systematic approach to bug recreation, root cause analysis, or resolution workflow that leverages the agent mesh capabilities.

### Market Opportunity

A Deep Debugger provides:
- **Systematic Bug Resolution**: Structured workflow from bug report to verified fix
- **AI-Augmented Root Cause Analysis**: Leverage tech-lead-orchestrator's architectural knowledge
- **Reproducible Bug Recreation**: Convert bug reports into automated test cases
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure bugs stay fixed through regression testing
- **Knowledge Capture**: Document debugging patterns for future reference

## Product Goals
