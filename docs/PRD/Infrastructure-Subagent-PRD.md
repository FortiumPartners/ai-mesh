# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Infrastructure Management Subagent

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: September 6, 2025  
**Author**: Technical Product Team  
**Status**: Draft for Review  

---

## Summary

We are building a specialized **Infrastructure Management Subagent** to address the critical gap in cloud infrastructure provisioning, container orchestration, and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) capabilities within our AI-augmented development ecosystem. 

This subagent will provide expert-level automation for Kubernetes configurations, Terraform AWS modules, Docker containerization, and infrastructure orchestration, enabling development teams to provision and manage production-ready infrastructure 70% faster while maintaining security and reliability standards.

**Problem Statement**: Development teams currently face significant delays in infrastructure setup, inconsistent configurations across environments, and security vulnerabilities in manually created infrastructure. Our current agent mesh lacks specialized infrastructure expertise, forcing teams to context-switch between development and DevOps responsibilities.

**Solution Overview**: A specialized infrastructure subagent that integrates seamlessly with our existing agent mesh, providing automated infrastructure design, configuration generation, and deployment orchestration while enforcing best practices and security standards.

## Goals / Non-goals

- **Seamless Agent Mesh Integration**: Operate within existing orchestration patterns with clear handoff protocols
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Support dev, staging, and production environments with appropriate configurations
- **Cost Optimization**: Implement resource optimization patterns to reduce AWS infrastructure costs by 30%

### Non-goals  
- **Multi-cloud Support**: Focus exclusively on AWS in v1 (Azure/GCP in future iterations)
- **Legacy Infrastructure Migration**: No brownfield infrastructure modernization (greenfield only)
- **Database Administration**: Database-specific management delegated to specialized DBA agents
