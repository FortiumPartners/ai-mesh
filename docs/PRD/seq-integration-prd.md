# Product Requirements Document: Seq Structured Logging Integration

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Author**: Product Management Team  
**Project**: Monitoring Web Service Seq Integration  

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the integration of Seq structured logging into both the frontend and backend components of the existing monitoring web service. Seq will provide centralized, structured logging with powerful querying capabilities, enhanced observability, and improved debugging experiences for development and production environments.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

The current monitoring web service lacks comprehensive structured logging capabilities, making it difficult to:
- Debug issues across distributed components (frontend/backend)
- Correlate events between frontend user actions and backend API calls
- Perform efficient log analysis and troubleshooting
- Maintain audit trails for compliance and security

### Business Objectives

1. **Enhanced Observability**: Provide comprehensive visibility into application behavior across all components
2. **Improved Debugging**: Reduce time-to-resolution for production issues by 60%
3. **Operational Excellence**: Enable proactive monitoring and alerting based on structured log data
4. **Compliance Support**: Maintain detailed audit trails for security and regulatory requirements
5. **Developer Productivity**: Improve development and debugging experience with rich log context

## Product Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR-1: Backend Seq Integration
- **Description**: Integrate Seq structured logging into the Node.js/Express backend
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Components**:
  - Install and configure `seq-logging` npm package following https://datalust.co/docs/using-nodejs
  - Replace existing console.log statements with structured Seq logging
  - Implement correlation IDs for request tracing
  - Configure log levels (Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Fatal)
  - Add contextual properties (userId, tenantId, requestId, operation)

#### FR-2: Frontend Seq Integration  
- **Description**: Integrate Seq logging into the React frontend application
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Components**:
  - Install and configure browser-compatible Seq client
  - Implement client-side error logging with stack traces
  - Log user interactions and navigation events
  - Capture performance metrics and timing data
  - Handle offline scenarios with log buffering

#### FR-3: Correlation and Tracing
- **Description**: Implement end-to-end request correlation between frontend and backend
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Components**:
  - Generate correlation IDs in frontend and propagate to backend
  - Include correlation IDs in all log entries
  - Track complete user workflows across service boundaries
  - Implement distributed tracing for API calls

## Acceptance Criteria

### Backend Logging Implementation
**Given** the Express API server is running  
**When** any API endpoint is called  
**Then** a structured log entry should be created in Seq with:
- Request details (method, path, headers)
- Response details (status, timing)
- Correlation ID
- User/tenant context
- Any errors or warnings

### Frontend Error Logging
**Given** a user is interacting with the React application  
**When** a JavaScript error occurs  
**Then** an error log should be sent to Seq containing:
- Error message and stack trace
- User context and session information
- Browser and device information
- Correlation ID for backend request correlation

### End-to-End Tracing
**Given** a user performs an action that triggers API calls  
**When** viewing logs in Seq  
**Then** I should be able to trace the complete workflow using correlation IDs from:
- Frontend user action
- API request initiation
- Backend processing
- Database operations
- Response delivery

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Integration (Following https://datalust.co/docs/using-nodejs)

```javascript
// Install: npm install seq-logging
const winston = require('winston');
require('seq-logging');

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.errors({ stack: true }),
    winston.format.json()
  ),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),
    new winston.transports.Seq({
      serverUrl: process.env.SEQ_SERVER_URL || 'http://localhost:5341',
      apiKey: process.env.SEQ_API_KEY,
      onError: (e => { console.error('[Seq]', e) })
    })
  ]
});

// Usage with structured logging
logger.info('User {user} performed {action}', {
  user: user.name,
  action: 'login',
  userId: user.id,
  ipAddress: req.ip,
  correlationId: req.correlationId
});
```

### Frontend Integration

```javascript
// Frontend Seq client for error logging
const logError = async (error, context) => {
  try {
    await fetch('/api/logs', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        level: 'Error',
        message: error.message,
        stack: error.stack,
        correlationId: context.correlationId,
        userId: context.userId,
        url: window.location.href,
        userAgent: navigator.userAgent
      })
    });
  } catch (logError) {
    console.warn('Failed to send error log:', logError);
  }
};
```

## Performance Requirements

- **Backend Logging Overhead**: < 5ms per log entry
- **Frontend Logging Impact**: < 1% impact on page load times
- **Log Ingestion Rate**: Support 10,000+ log entries per minute
- **Logging Availability**: 99.9% uptime for log ingestion

## Security Requirements

- **Data Protection**: No sensitive data (passwords, tokens) in log entries
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to Seq dashboard and logs
- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for all log transmission
- **Retention**: Configurable log retention (default 30 days)
