# Product Requirements Document: Enhanced Real-Time Activity Feed

## Summary

We need to enhance the real-time activity feed in our monitoring web service to provide meaningful, actionable insights for developers and system administrators. Currently, the activity feed shows only "pre and post execution messages" without sufficient context about what actions were performed, their outcomes, or their business impact. This enhancement will transform the activity feed from a basic event log into a comprehensive operational intelligence dashboard that enables users to understand system behavior, troubleshoot issues, and optimize development workflows.

## Goals / Non-goals

### Goals

- **Actionable Intelligence**: Transform activity data from basic event logging to meaningful operational insights
- **Enhanced Context**: Provide rich context for every activity including inputs, outputs, performance metrics, and business impact
- **Improved Debugging**: Enable developers to quickly identify and resolve issues through detailed activity traces
- **Performance Visibility**: Surface performance metrics and trends to optimize system and development workflows
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Maintain real-time updates while providing comprehensive data without overwhelming users
- **User Experience**: Create an intuitive interface that adapts to different user roles and information needs

### Non-goals

- **Historical Analytics**: Deep historical analysis and reporting (covered by separate analytics modules)
- **External System Integration**: Integration with third-party monitoring tools (future iteration)
- **Custom Alerting**: Complex alerting rules and notifications (separate alerting system)
- **Video/Screenshot Capture**: Visual recording of activities (performance concerns)
