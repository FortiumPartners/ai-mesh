# PRD: Intelligent Agent Discovery System

**Product Name**: AI Mesh Agent Recommendation Engine
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Status**: Approved for Development
**Priority**: P0 (Immediate Win)
**Owner**: AI Mesh Product Team

---

## Executive Summary

The Intelligent Agent Discovery System introduces a `/recommend` command that analyzes users' task descriptions and project context to suggest optimal agents, workflows, and command sequences. This feature addresses the critical adoption barrier where users are overwhelmed by 26 specialized agents and 130+ documentation files.

**Problem**: New and existing users struggle to determine which agents to use for their tasks, resulting in underutilization of the system's capabilities and high cognitive load.

**Solution**: An intelligent recommendation engine that uses NLP-based task analysis, framework detection, and agent specialization matching to provide confidence-scored suggestions with expected outcomes and time estimates.

**Impact**: 70% reduction in cognitive load, 45% increase in agent utilization, dramatically improved onboarding experience.

---

## Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

1. **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Simplify agent selection by 70% through intelligent recommendations
2. **Accelerate Onboarding**: Enable new users to be productive within 5 minutes
3. **Increase Utilization**: Improve agent usage by 45% through better discovery
4. **Provide Context**: Offer clear rationale for recommendations with confidence scores
5. **Enable Learning**: Help users understand which agents solve which problems

### Non-Goals

1. **Replace Agent Execution**: Not building a new agent, only a recommendation system
2. **Automatic Execution**: Will not automatically execute recommended workflows without user consent
3. **Custom Agent Creation**: Will not generate new agents based on user needs
4. **Complex ML Training**: Initial version uses rule-based + simple NLP, not deep learning

## Appendix

### A. Example Recommendation Output

```
$ /recommend "I need to deploy my React app to Kubernetes with SSL"

🎯 Recommended Workflow (Confidence: 94%)

Primary Agent:
  • infrastructure-developer (95% match)
    Specializes in: Kubernetes, Docker, SSL/TLS configuration
    Why: Detected K8s manifests + SSL requirement + deployment intent

Workflow Steps:
  1. infrastructure-developer: Generate K8s Deployment + Service
  2. infrastructure-developer: Configure Ingress with TLS
  3. code-reviewer: Validate security configuration

  Estimated Time: 15-20 minutes
  Expected Output: deployment.yaml, service.yaml, ingress.yaml, SSL certs

Alternative Approaches:
  🔄 Use Helm Charts (infrastructure-developer + Helm skills)
     Pros: Better for complex configs, easier updates
     Cons: +5 minutes setup time
     Confidence: 88%

  🔄 Deploy to Fly.io instead (infrastructure-developer + Fly.io skills)
     Pros: Simpler, automatic SSL, faster deployment
     Cons: Different platform than K8s
     Confidence: 85%

Quick Start:
  /delegate infrastructure-developer "Create K8s deployment with SSL for React app"

Need help? Run: /recommend --help
```

### B. Detection Patterns (Subset)

```json
{
  "deploy": ["deploy", "deployment", "production", "ship", "release"],
  "review": ["review", "audit", "check", "validate", "security"],
  "test": ["test", "e2e", "unit", "integration", "playwright"],
  "build": ["build", "compile", "bundle", "package"],
  "kubernetes": ["k8s", "kubernetes", "kubectl", "deployment"],
  "react": ["react", "jsx", "component", "hooks"]
}
```

### C. Confidence Scoring Algorithm (Simplified)

```typescript
function calculateConfidence(task, agent, context) {
  let score = 0;

  // Intent match (0-40 points)
  score += intentMatch(task.intent, agent.specialization) * 40;

  // Framework match (0-30 points)
  score += frameworkMatch(context.frameworks, agent.skills) * 30;

  // Historical success (0-20 points)
  score += historicalSuccessRate(agent, task.type) * 20;

  // Context fit (0-10 points)
  score += contextFit(context.complexity, agent.capabilities) * 10;

  return Math.min(100, Math.max(0, score));
}
```
