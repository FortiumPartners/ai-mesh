# PRD: Claude Configuration Node.js Installer Module

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Product**: Claude Configuration Installer
**Project Type**: Infrastructure & Developer Tools
**Status**: Planning Phase

---

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement

The current Claude Configuration installation system relies on a 600+ line bash script (`install.sh`) that, while functional, presents several limitations:

- **Platform Dependency**: Bash-only installation limits Windows compatibility and creates maintenance overhead
- **Limited Programmatic Access**: No API for CI/CD integration or automated deployments
- **Version Management**: No package distribution or update mechanism beyond git pulls
- **Error Recovery**: Limited rollback capabilities and inconsistent error handling
- **Extensibility**: Monolithic script design prevents plugin architecture or customization

### Solution Overview

Transform the installation system into a professional Node.js module that preserves all existing functionality while adding enterprise-grade features:

- **Cross-Platform NPM Package**: Unified installation across macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Dual Interface**: CLI for interactive use + programmatic API for automation
- **Enhanced UX**: Progress tracking, detailed logging, rollback capabilities
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible design for custom installations and configurations
- **CLAUDE.md Integration**: Automated updating of project documentation with agent references

### Business Impact

- **30% Faster Onboarding**: Streamlined installation reduces setup time from 15 minutes to <5 minutes
- **100% Platform Coverage**: Support for Windows development teams previously excluded
- **50% Reduction in Support Tickets**: Better error handling and validation reduces installation issues
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated deployment capabilities for enterprise customers
