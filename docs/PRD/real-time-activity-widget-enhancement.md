## 1. Product Summary

### Problem Statement
The current Real-time Activity widget in the monitoring web service dashboard provides minimal visibility into tool executions, showing only basic activity notifications without context about who executed what tools, when they were executed, or detailed information about the operations. This limits the ability of development teams and technical leads to monitor productivity, troubleshoot issues, and understand workflow patterns in real-time.

### Product Vision
Transform the Real-time Activity widget into a comprehensive, interactive monitoring tool that provides detailed visibility into all tool executions across the development workflow, enabling teams to track productivity, identify bottlenecks, and optimize their AI-augmented development processes.

### Business Impact
- **Improved Visibility**: 100% transparency into development tool usage and patterns
- **Enhanced Productivity**: 25% reduction in troubleshooting time through detailed activity logs
- **Better Decision Making**: Data-driven insights into tool effectiveness and usage patterns
- **Process Optimization**: Identify workflow bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals
- **Primary**: Display comprehensive tool execution information (what, who, when) in real-time
- **Primary**: Provide interactive detail views for different tool types with contextual information
- **Secondary**: Enable filtering and searching of activity history
- **Secondary**: Support real-time notifications for critical events
