## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the strategic migration from the current Seq structured logging solution to a comprehensive OpenTelemetry (OTEL) observability stack with SignOz as the backend. This migration will modernize our observability infrastructure, provide unified telemetry collection (logs, metrics, traces), and establish a foundation for advanced monitoring, alerting, and distributed tracing capabilities.

## Product Context

### Current State Analysis

- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks, performance metrics, and error handling
- **Production Features**: Automatic failover, buffer management, and graceful degradation

### Strategic Rationale

**Business Drivers**:
- **Vendor Independence**: Reduce dependency on proprietary logging solutions
- **Cost Optimization**: Leverage open-source observability stack for improved TCO
- **Standardization**: Adopt industry-standard OpenTelemetry for vendor-neutral telemetry
- **Enhanced Observability**: Unified logs, metrics, and traces in single platform
- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling with better debugging and monitoring capabilities

**Technical Drivers**:
