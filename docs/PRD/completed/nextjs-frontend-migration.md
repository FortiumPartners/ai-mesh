### Server vs Client Components Strategy

**Server Components (Default)**:
- Layout components
- Static dashboard widgets
- User profiles and settings pages
- Navigation and sidebar components

**Client Components (`'use client'`)**:
- Interactive charts and visualizations
- Form inputs and validation
- WebSocket real-time components
- Modal dialogs and dropdowns
- Redux state management components

### Data Fetching Migration

**Current**: React Query + useEffect hooks
**Target**: Server Components + selective Client Components

```typescript
// Current Pattern
const DashboardPage = () => {
  const { data } = useQuery(['metrics'], fetchMetrics)
  return <MetricsChart data={data} />
}

// Next.js Pattern
async function DashboardPage() {
  const metrics = await fetchMetrics() // Server Component
  return <MetricsChart data={metrics} /> // Client Component
}
```
