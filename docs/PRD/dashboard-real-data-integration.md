# Product Requirements Document: Dashboard Real Data Integration

**Product**: Monitoring Web Service Dashboard Data Integration  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Author**: Product Management Team  
**Status**: Draft  

## Executive Summary

The Monitoring Web Service currently utilizes mock data across multiple dashboard widgets for development and testing purposes. This PRD outlines the requirements for transitioning all dashboard widgets to consume real data from backend APIs, ensuring accurate metrics display, improved user experience, and production-ready functionality.

### Business Context

The monitoring dashboard serves as the primary interface for users to track productivity metrics, real-time activities, tool usage analytics, and personal insights. Currently, all widgets display mock data, preventing users from accessing actual performance metrics and limiting the platform's value proposition.

### Success Criteria

- 100% elimination of mock data across all dashboard widgets
- Real-time data updates for activity monitoring
- Historical data visualization for trend analysis
- Performance metrics meeting SLA requirements (<2s load time, <500ms update latency)
- 99.5% data accuracy and consistency

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Dashboard Widgets

Based on codebase analysis, the following widgets currently use mock data:

1. **ProductivityTrendsWidget** (`ProductivityTrendsWidget.tsx`)
   - Displays productivity metrics over time
   - Currently uses hardcoded mock data arrays
   - Requires trend calculation and historical data aggregation

2. **RealTimeActivityWidget** (`RealTimeActivityWidget.tsx`)
   - Shows live activity feed and current user actions
   - Uses mock activity events with static timestamps
   - Requires WebSocket integration for real-time updates

3. **ToolUsageAnalyticsWidget** (`ToolUsageAnalyticsWidget.tsx`)
   - Displays tool usage statistics and patterns
   - Contains mock usage data with predefined categories
   - Needs aggregated metrics from actual tool usage events

4. **PersonalInsightsWidget** (`PersonalInsightsWidget.tsx`)
   - Provides personalized productivity insights and recommendations
   - Uses mock insights and achievement data
   - Requires ML-based insights generation from user data

### Backend Infrastructure Assessment

**Existing API Endpoints**:
- `/api/metrics/*` - Basic metrics collection endpoints
- `/api/analytics/*` - Analytics processing endpoints
- WebSocket support via `enhanced-websocket.service.ts`
- Prisma database integration with comprehensive schema

**Data Processing Services**:
- `metrics-processing.service.ts` - Core metrics processing
- `metrics-aggregation.service.ts` - Data aggregation functionality
- `real-time-processor.service.ts` - Real-time event processing
- `enhanced-websocket.service.ts` - WebSocket management

**Frontend State Management**:
- Redux with `metricsSlice.ts` for state management
- `api.ts` service for HTTP client functionality
- WebSocket context for real-time updates
