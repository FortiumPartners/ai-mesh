# Acceptance Criteria Guidelines

## Purpose
Acceptance criteria define the boundaries of a feature and specify the expected behavior from the user's perspective. They serve as the contract between product requirements and technical implementation.

## Structure

### Format: Given-When-Then (Gherkin Style)
```
Given [initial context/state]
When [action/event occurs]  
Then [expected outcome/result]
```

### Alternative: Checklist Format
```
- [ ] User can perform action X
- [ ] System responds with Y
- [ ] Error case Z is handled appropriately
```

## Quality Standards

### Testable
- Each criterion must be verifiable through testing
- Specific and measurable outcomes
- Clear pass/fail conditions

### Complete
- Cover happy path scenarios
- Include edge cases and error conditions  
- Address all user types and permissions

### Unambiguous
- Use clear, precise language
- Avoid technical jargon unless necessary
- Include examples when helpful

## Essential Categories

### Functional Requirements
- Core feature functionality
- User interactions and workflows
- Data processing and business logic
- Integration behavior

### Performance Requirements  
- Response time targets (e.g., "Page loads in < 2 seconds")
- Throughput requirements (e.g., "Handles 1000 concurrent users")
- Resource usage limits

### Security Requirements
- Authentication requirements
- Authorization rules
- Data protection measures
- Input validation requirements

### Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast requirements

### Cross-Browser/Device Requirements
- Supported browsers and versions
- Mobile responsiveness
- Device-specific behaviors

### Error Handling
- Expected error messages
- Graceful degradation
- Recovery mechanisms
- User guidance for error states

## Example Template

```markdown
## Feature: User Registration

### AC1: Valid Registration
Given a user visits the registration page
When they enter valid email, password, and confirm password
Then they should receive a confirmation email
And be redirected to the welcome page
And their account should be created with 'pending' status

### AC2: Invalid Email
Given a user enters an invalid email format
When they attempt to register  
Then they should see "Please enter a valid email address" error
And the registration should not proceed

### AC3: Password Requirements
Given a user enters a password
When the password is less than 8 characters
Then they should see "Password must be at least 8 characters" error
And the submit button should be disabled

### AC4: Performance
Given the registration form is submitted
When all validations pass
Then the user should receive feedback within 2 seconds
And the confirmation email should be sent within 30 seconds

### AC5: Accessibility
Given a user navigates with keyboard only
When they tab through the registration form
Then all form fields should be focusable
And form labels should be announced by screen readers
```
